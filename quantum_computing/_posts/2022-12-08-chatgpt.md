I've pasted into ChatGPT the 'Quantum computing for the very curious' book by  Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen. I've asked him to summarize it, then followed up with some questions:

Q: Summarize the book below:

Quantum computing for the very curious is a book that presents an introduction to the basics of quantum computing. The book is organized into three main parts: Part I covers the state of a qubit, Part II introduces quantum logic gates and Part III discusses universal quantum computing. The book explains the concepts of quantum computing in a way that is accessible to readers with no previous knowledge of the topic, and it uses a mnemonic medium to make the material easy to remember. Special thanks are given to the sponsors who funded the book, including Adam Wiggins, Andrew Sutherland, and Paul Sutter.

Q: In more detail, what is an X gate? And a H gate?

---

An X gate, also known as a NOT gate, is a fundamental quantum logic gate that performs a bit flip on a single qubit. This means that if the qubit is in the state "0", the X gate will change it to the state "1", and if the qubit is in the state "1", the X gate will change it to the state "0". The X gate is often used in quantum circuits as a building block for more complex operations.

A H gate, also known as a Hadamard gate, is another fundamental quantum logic gate that is used to put a qubit into a superposition state. This means that the qubit is in a linear combination of the "0" and "1" states, with equal probability amplitudes. The H gate is used in many quantum algorithms, including the quantum search algorithm and the quantum teleportation algorithm. It is also often used in conjunction with other gates to perform more complex operations.

Q: How are gates expressed as hermitian matrices?

---

Quantum logic gates can be represented as matrices, and specifically as hermitian matrices. A hermitian matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose, which means that the elements on the diagonal are real numbers and the elements off the diagonal are equal to their complex conjugates. This property is useful for quantum computing because it guarantees that the matrix will preserve the inner product of two quantum states.

For example, the X gate can be represented as the hermitian matrix:

X = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

This matrix represents the operation of flipping the state of a qubit from "0" to "1" or vice versa. The H gate, on the other hand, can be represented as the hermitian matrix:

H = 1 / sqrt(2) * [[1, 1], [1, -1]]

This matrix represents the operation of putting a qubit into a superposition state, with equal probability amplitudes for the "0" and "1" states. These matrices can be multiplied together or combined with other gates to perform more complex operations on a qubit or a group of qubits.

Q: What are the general states of a qbit?

---

A qubit, the fundamental unit of quantum information, can exist in a number of different states. The most basic states of a qubit are the "0" state and the "1" state, which correspond to the classical states of a bit in classical computing. However, unlike classical bits, qubits can also exist in superposition states, which are linear combinations of the "0" and "1" states with complex probability amplitudes. This means that a qubit can be in a state that is both "0" and "1" at the same time, with a certain probability of being measured as "0" and a certain probability of being measured as "1".

Additionally, qubits can exist in entanglement states, in which the state of one qubit is correlated with the state of another qubit. This allows for the creation of entangled quantum systems in which the state of one qubit can affect the state of another qubit, even when the qubits are separated by large distances. These various states of a qubit are important for quantum computing, as they allow for the representation and manipulation of quantum information in ways that are impossible with classical bits.

Q: How is a qbit expressed in an arbitrary computational basis? How does the qbit formula change if I change the computational basis?

---

A qubit can be expressed in an arbitrary computational basis by representing the qubit as a two-dimensional complex vector. This vector can be written in terms of the computational basis states "0" and "1" as:

```
|psi> = a|0> + b|1>
```

where a and b are complex probability amplitudes that satisfy the normalization condition |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. This expression represents the state of the qubit in the computational basis "0" and "1", and it shows that the qubit is in a superposition of these two basis states with the given probability amplitudes.

If the computational basis is changed from "0" and "1" to a different basis, such as "+" and "-", the formula for the qubit state will change accordingly. For example, if the computational basis is changed to "+" and "-", the qubit state can be written as:

```
|psi> = c|+> + d|->
```

where c and d are the complex probability amplitudes in the new basis. In this case, the qubit is still in a superposition of the "+" and "-" states, but the probability amplitudes have changed to reflect the new basis. The specific values of the probability amplitudes will depend on the specific state of the qubit and the transformation that is applied to change the basis.

Q: Why is the quantum state of a qbit a unitary vector in the two dimensional complex space?

---

The quantum state of a qubit is a unitary vector in the two-dimensional complex space because unitary vectors are the only vectors that preserve the inner product of two quantum states. This is an important property for quantum computing, as it allows for the manipulation of quantum states in a way that is consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics.

A unitary vector is a vector that has unit magnitude and is unchanged by a unitary transformation. In the case of a qubit, the magnitude of the quantum state vector is always equal to 1, and a unitary transformation is a linear transformation that preserves the inner product of two vectors. This means that if the quantum state of a qubit is represented by the vector |psi>, and a unitary transformation U is applied to the qubit, the resulting quantum state will be given by the vector U|psi>.

In general, the quantum state of a qubit can be written as a linear combination of the computational basis states "0" and "1", with complex probability amplitudes:

```
|psi> = a|0> + b|1>
```

where a and b are complex numbers that satisfy the normalization condition |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. This expression shows that the quantum state of a qubit is a unitary vector in the two-dimensional complex space, as it has unit magnitude and is unchanged by unit
