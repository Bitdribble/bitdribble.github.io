Q: In what way is quantum computing universal among types of computing?

---

Quantum computing is universal in the sense that it can be used to perform any computation that a classical computer can perform, given enough time and resources. This is because a quantum computer can be programmed to simulate the behavior of any classical algorithm, using its ability to manipulate quantum bits (qubits) to perform operations that would be difficult or impossible for a classical computer.

Q: Are there types of computing that are not classical, and not quantum computing?

---

Yes, there are other types of computing that are not classical or quantum. For example, some researchers have proposed using other physical phenomena, such as superconductivity or spin, to create computing systems that operate according to different principles than classical or quantum computers. These types of computing are often called "non-classical" or "non-quantum" computing.
