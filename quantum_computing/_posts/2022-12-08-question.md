Reading from Matuschak & Nielsen [[Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc)]:

```
A fundamental fact about this measurement process is that it disturbs the state of the quantum system. In particular, it doesn’t just leave the quantum state alone. After the measurement, if you get the outcome 0 then the state of the qubit afterwards (the “posterior state”) is the computational basis state ∣0>. On the other hand, if you get the outcome 11 then the posterior state of the qubit is the computational basis state ∣1>.

Summing all this up: if we measure a qubit with state α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩α∣0⟩+β∣1⟩ in the computational basis, then the outcome is a classical bit: either 00, with probability ∣α∣2∣α∣2, or 11, with probability ∣β∣2∣β∣2. The corresponding state of the qubit after the measurement is ∣0⟩∣0⟩ or ∣1⟩∣1⟩.

A key point to note is that after the measurement [of ], no matter what the outcome, αα and ββ are gone. No matter whether the posterior state is ∣0⟩∣0⟩ or ∣1⟩∣1⟩, there is no trace of αα or ββ. And so you can’t get any more information about them. In that sense, αα and ββ are a kind of hidden information – the measurement doesn’t tell you what they were.*

One reason this is important is because it means you can’t store an infinite amount of classical information in a qubit. After all, αα is a complex number, and you could imagine storing lots of classical bits in the binary expansion of the real component of αα. If there was some experimental way you could measure the value of αα exactly, then you could extract that classical information. But without a way of measuring αα that’s not possible.
