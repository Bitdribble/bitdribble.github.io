#### Books
* [C - A Reference Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Reference-Manual-Samuel-P-Harbison/dp/013089592X), Samuel P. Harbison, Guy L. Steele Jr (1984)
* [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/), Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (1988 vintage)
* [lex & yacc](https://www.amazon.com/lex-yacc-Doug-Brown-ebook/dp/B009THDEBC), John R. Levine, Tony Mason & Doug Brown (1990,1995). The closest I got to compiler design. (Not very close!). I also followed an MIT IAP class on lex & yacc back around 2000-2005 which was really helpful. 'The C Programming Language' has, I think, a nice simple lex & yacc example at the end.
