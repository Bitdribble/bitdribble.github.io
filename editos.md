Like any self-respecting software engineer, my world is in Emacs. Or seen through an Emacs text window. I also use vi for quick config file edits.

More recently, I started using VSCode, with the Github Copilot extension. Copilot now write about 40% of my code. I can program in new languages, too. I am so hooked that I worry I'll forget the basics.
