Zoox CEO Aicha Evans and CTO Jesse Levinson [talk with Recode's Kara Swisher](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aicha-evans-jesse-levinson-self-driving-taxis-will/id1011668648?i=1000467611902) about their development of a fully autonomous robo-taxi.

By end of 2020, Zoox had [$1B in funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoox), and was acquired by Amazon for $1.2B.
