title: How to Build a Self Driving Car
---
Our goal is to describe
* The components of a self driving car
* The engineering needed to build it, incrementally, and component wise. The best technology is built by evolution of simpler components, from basic to complex.
* The skills needed to build each component
* How to find information about building the various components. Some good books describing general robotics or machine learning are available ([Probabilistic Robots](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf), and [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/14920326461)). However, no book seems to exist in print at this time that will describe the full technological stack of a self driving car, from start to end.
