The source of this post is [Foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Python-Hands/dp/0135172381), a nice book by Laura Graesser and Wah Loon Keng. I'm working through Chapter 2, practicing the REINFORCE algorithm.

In reinforcement learning, an agent acts on the environment with action a<sub>t</sub>. The result of the action

REINFORCE is perhaps the most basic algorithm for deep reinforcement learning.
