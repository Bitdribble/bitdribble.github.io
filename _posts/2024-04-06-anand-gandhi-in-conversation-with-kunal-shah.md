CRED curious: [Anand Gandhi in conversation with Kunal Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf09vjWp3E4) (2020)


Transcript: (needs tobe cleaned up)

my hello and a very warm welcome to
everyone from cred we are very very excited to bring to you cred curious
a series that aims to unlearn the thought process philosophy and ingenuity that drive some
of the brightest minds joining us today are two brilliant thinkers kunal shah founder cred and anand gandhi
a multi-disciplinarian thinker filmmaker and entrepreneur in this candid conversation
prepare to be reveled by the unique worldviews that emerge from the convergence of both kunal and anand's
practice one of which will be the evolution of money through the lens of biology to everyone who's
joined us today from all around the world thank you and welcome to the credit curious community
that rewards curiosity please maintain decorum in your interaction with everyone here on the live stream
the session is being recorded and will be available right after the stream ends for more sessions and conversations like
these subscribe to our channel and stay updated and now without further ado
please make some cheer in the chat section and help me welcome anan gandhi and kunal shah
hello hello hello hello anand uh can you hear me
hey hey hey welcome to curious anand this is a project that we
spoke about long ago finally has come to life uh
i am excited about this i'm already excited because our five-minute conversation was already crazy before
this uh so we're gonna go a little crazy be your usual self uh and uh for a lot of people who
uh are from my world who probably don't know about your world why don't you give us a quick intro but
Anand's Introduction
i'll i'll make a quick uh quick thing that you probably hired from talking about but you were the
guy who wrote the soap opera uh of cookie sauce
you wrote all of this from the lens of biology that's uh the most mind-blowing intro that i
have kind of come up with for you but you obviously have done way more than that so why don't you give your intro
thanks and this is absolutely amazing you know the the idea that um every time every
time i make a film and every time i make characters that are that are sophisticated in their in their inquiry in their and
and rigorous in their inquiry a lot of audience members turn around and say hey this is this was really mind-blowing but who really talks like
this and i i always in my defense i always say wait till you see my friends tonight talk and this is this is a fantastic
opportunity to let let our audiences get a glimpse of how you and i incessantly
uh go go on uh binging on ideas and and epiphanies and insights of that that
we share with each other so um that's really what we do my friends and i we we started a company
a couple of years ago but even before that in the last 20 years what i've really done is looked at the greatest breakthroughs in
in our uh in the human civilization greatest breakthroughs in
towards questions like who am i what you know what is life all about how did i get here what do i do with it is there a
meaning things like that really things that we questions we ask ourselves as children and we somehow somewhere along the lines
along the uh the journey that we take in our lives we some of us forget to to
to answer these questions we answer those questions for for everyone we answer them for ourselves and we find these answers and translate these answers because it a lot
of these answers are not bumper stickers they take 20 30 40 years to arrive at so you translate these answers into into
stories into intuitive experiences into into something that you don't necessarily need to spend 23 years of your life of philosophical
inquiry to to be able to understand or comprehend we we convert them into metaphors and allegories that are extremely
biologically experiential for you so essentially we make films and games to put it very simply we make cinema shows
and games uh i've made in the past for those of you who are tuning in who do not know my
work i've made films like bombard ship of theseus and insignificant man i've
produced a board game called shasan i've just recently produced a show that's
coming out on disney hotstar called okay computer i've i've made many many plays my plays have
been very warmly welcomed and received uh for a very long time my television has my television work
uh was was uh was work of my uh was work of a teenage explorer i was
19 when i was writing television i was 21 when i retired from television so um and that's that's that's part of my
defense and part in my context so so that's really what we do we we take great ideas and convert them to
cinematic experiences to gamified experiences so that they can they can be very very uh entertaining
uh while they're in enlightening uh ana i have to ask you this question you
Anand's journey without an education degree
do not have a lot of formal degrees and i i don't know if you even have a degree but
you're probably the most knowledgeable person on many many topics i know tell you can you tell me how did that
happen how did somebody who barely got any education become the way that you've become right uh
you know this more than anybody does uh you we've known each other for so many years and you know so so many conversations uh
we're going to have i'm just realizing the way you phrase this question is for your audience's benefit
because you you know the you know very well the answer to this question because that applies to you as well um and i know you well enough to know
that this completely applies to you as well that we we chose
we chose our journeys away from formal education uh not to run away from education but run
towards education our common institutions were not uh not
giving us sufficient opportunities to manifest our intellectual capacities and uh given the given the amount of
given the the the vastness of the intellectual inquiry the questions that that one was bubbling with uh that i was
bubbling with when i was 16 i was i was finding the the education that i was receiving
very inadequate in its uh in its rigor and it's uh in its uh in its ability to
to to enlighten me in its ability to to even begin to even uh keep up with my uh with
with my own rigor and my own pace and i i removed myself from from formal
institutions at a very early age from the uh at the age of 17 and rigorously designed my own learning journey so i
created a bespoke journey for myself that included pretty much everything and that time of course i didn't know that i'm going to
emerge as a systems thinker or a complexity thinker out of out of all of this i didn't even know that there is such a thing as complex
complexity thinking or choice architecture or or the fancy things that you and i speak about very often now uh at that time i knew intuitively that
there is something um that there is there ought to be a science that connects everything
and that was the intuition that i was blindly following so i knew that i have to learn magic i have to learn
theater i have to learn culture i have to understand how narratives and metaphors and language
have evolved i have to understand for that too and to truly understand that i have to truly understand how the brain
works how cognition works how comprehension works so for that i need to understand neuroscience but neuroscience is just engineering it's boring i mean it's at
the end of the day it's i mean at the end it's like something goes awesome in some part of the brain and something gets a signal but that's that's not sufficient to
explain anything so you need to understand evolutionary biology why it occurred in the first place you have to learn that you have to
understand why biology happened in the first place so you understand organic chemistry and so on and so forth so i knew that i had to learn everything
and uh and thai was always short and i was running from one program to another trying to educate myself and and and somewhere along the lines i met
great friends great peers great mentors uh who who kept who kept shaping my life's journey and we
we kind of informed each other's course connections i think that's that's in on the same journey that you and i
also met each other uh it's super relatable uh i think the
randomness to getting to the truth which is we'll probably never get in our lifetime
uh is so much fun because we keep going to these different parts which sometimes goes into physics
sometimes goes into biology uh uh sometimes uh gives you a lesson from history and and sometimes uh something pops up
on a tick tock video and you're like okay now it clicks because somebody has some simplified this
is a complex concept in a 10 second video right yeah but but let's move to this topic
that we decided to kind of talk about uh and we've almost arrived this similar episode so i'm gonna straight away
go into that yeah yeah we both concluded that money is nothing but a battery
Biology of Money
that's right let's just zoom out and talk from a pure evolutionary biology
perspective that how do you think humanity managed to
get to money first how is it such an important part of our life why does it drive us why does it make us
sad why is it so interlinked to life why is it almost life why don't you kind of go and zoom
out zoom in at will absolutely no that's that's such a fantastic question like i was telling
you that you know i spent the last seven years of my life very rigorously answering a wide variety of questions on
on on human behavior and and found some very satisfactory answers that you and i have spoken about endlessly over the
last few years that we've known each other uh but this this is a this is a a particular beast
money is is is a memetic invention like you said it's a it's a battery it's an innovation it's a human innovation it
does not exist in other species uh trade exists economics exists hoarding uh extortion all kinds of other tactics
of of of economies do exist in other species from fungi to bacteria to all other
species but money almost doesn't exist in any other species but in our species so what
i'm going to pause can you talk a little bit about how this extortion exist in other species and and talk about any
other uh we think that the human behavior still is human but is another species can you
talk about that yes so um so there are there are so many of our behaviors that we we imagined were
invented by by humans but if you if you start deep diving into any of these behaviors
you would find that they have origins in in evolution that will be found across
pretty much all the species like every species is any at any given point of time prey to something and predator to
something else uh and any given species is consuming something and giving something up
and in that it's locked in this rock papers is a relationship in this tritopic
interaction relationship with everything around it but uh but let's put a pin on that because that's of course a very big
question on on how we are different from other species and how we are similar to other species but i want to start with a with a very unique
example that occurred to me yesterday while i was thinking about this question of yours which is uh the biology of money itself and and
we'll come to the idea of why is why it is a metaphor and it's not real and and why it becomes real and becomes so
palpable for all of us we'll come to that let's put up in on that for a second pin on the question on
how is it that most human behaviors are found in other species as well but let's start with one one very
complex and sophisticated piece of human activity that happens almost every day and goes unnoticed it doesn't even make it
to front page news anymore so i want to talk about conceptual art for those of our audience papers who
Conceptual art and it's meaning
don't know what conceptual art is conceptual artists art that is not necessarily designed for an aesthetic experience
it's not designed for an experience of beauty uh you don't look at a piece of conceptual art and go like oh my god that just gave me the most
beautiful experience i could have imagined or the most saddening or the most emotive experience that i could have uh
imagined you look at a conceptual art and you go like okay so what is that okay so just to give you an example of a
very famous priceless piece of concept conceptual art uh it's called an oak tree by michael craig
martin and the oak tree is basically just a glass of water on a shelf on a glass
shelf where bike where the artist says this is the oak tree i have transmuted
this glass of water into an oak green right now what you're looking at is an oak tree it's not a glass of water it's an oak tree
now now somewhere along the lines you have to buy into that story to buy into transportation and buy into a
endless uh discourse that the artist is proposing and thereby creating this this framework
in which you are negotiating um now let's because this is a priceless piece of work so to go and find
something that has a price that has a price tag so let's talk about uh another another piece called apocalypse now now apocalypse now is a
conceptual art piece of art which is basically just words written with stencil on a bunch of frames so these are just like words like
psychotic and mercenary and things like that stenciled out literally black on white on a wall on a couple of frames on
a wall now this piece of art was sold for 26.5 million dollars it was sold for 197
crore rupees uh indian rupees uh now this doesn't make front page news anymore because we
have kind of made peace with the idea that art isn't you know our trade is an exorbitant world
but let's kind of recontextualize what that means it means that a piece of paper with some stenciled
words on it was sold for four crore kilograms of rice
or was sold for the sustenance of 150 000 farmers for an entire year
now that starts making us a little uncertain if we understand what the hell
is going on how did we get here how did we get to this point and that
truly blows my mind it's like nothing nothing short of mind-blowing that we have allowed this game to play itself
out to this extent and we still buy into it we still buy into this
this uh idea this idea that we can store like you said money's battery that we
can store we can take kinetic energy of a lifetime a farmer really labors through their life and the way to kind of ask demand that
labor back in life is to store that into virtual energy of some kind otherwise it dissipates so we have
allowed ourselves to to agree to that piece of metaphor we have said that okay let's kind of
create a create a symbol create a symbol of this label so that the symbol stays with us
and it does not dissipate i think if this mic falls away can you guys still hear me do you think it's still audible if this might kind of disappears
i can put it i i don't know i will find out keep going okay no as long as you can hear me then
we are all good okay okay i'm just
sorry about this yeah so um
now it doesn't it you know it doesn't it doesn't take us too long to kind of immediately look at any concept should be so far and recognize
immediately it doesn't necessarily hold an immediate acidic value to its viewer so it's a code it's a code of some kind
it's a it's a metaphor of some kind and in the case of conceptual art it's a metaphor of a metaphor
of a metaphor it's far removed so it's it's it's a mix of commentary context
critique reflection and the history of all the predecessor metaphors that led up to it
which is exchanged for this another metaphor which is 197 crore rupees which is by
itself a metaphor that is folded upon itself folded upon the context in the critique and the history of metaphors and the
reflection and the simulation of these metaphors that that we have allowed to play out in this computational model
that does not necessarily have preset rules the rules we have been making on the go the rules of money are rules that
we'll be making on the goal so we have said okay if money can have this quality can we put in throw in the quality of stock can
we throw in the quality of bonds without really recognizing that these qualities are not
isolated qualities these qualities are driven by human irrationalities human sentiments human behaviors
that now have vestiges all the way to fungi now that's where we kind of started drawing our relationship between
fungi and humans that we start drawing relationships between between extortion or or trade extortion between
fungi and plants and the kind of irrationalities that humans are capable of
the thing about abstracting concepts like money is so hard for most people that
it almost becomes hard to imagine and therefore hard to process and how to calculate but yeah let's
think about from a lens of biology uh social status exists clearly in many
Social Status impact
many species almost almost all species right like uh status drives uh uh mating success uh progeny
so on and so forth right and and almost every species is kind of using social status as a way to kind of propagate the
species and have the best ones kind of mate with the best ones but how did
this intermingle with human society what is the relationship of humans status money
and this interchangeability that we've kind of brought into that and and why do some people manage to unlock
status even without money and and what is the the mix over here and why is the
status unlocked to money slightly more sustainable than the status unlocked without money yeah yeah so i mean
um let's let's kind of take one question let's kind of isolate these questions so that we don't conclude too many things and you're absolutely right for you know
uh for for ourselves and for audiences that are tuning in um this is by by no means a trivial
question it's not a question that has been easily answered over the last uh a few centuries and at the same time being easily answered i mean
there are endless stories about uh endless parables about the sadhu laughing at the ll at the conqueror and saying that you can't eat
money at the end of the day you can't eat gold and silver and you can't eat this these metaphors that you've created and that and there are countless
stories about calling money maya uh or or an illusion now the reason metaphors and complex metaphors are that
cloud meta cloud-based metaphors of storage storage uh storage of like we said storage of labor storage of
human labor you need to store human labor somewhere in a in an agreed piece of metaphor and
agreed upon piece of cloud storage that that can be accessed
and that can be that that that can be
brought back by time and by resources so uh let's let's look at metaphor in
general before we even look at money as a metaphor because money is a very very sophisticated piece
of metaphor it's it's a computer it's a battery it's a it's an extremely evolved piece of metal
that we've invented for ourselves and that has really transformed our civilization completely and pretty much everything that has happened in human
civilization in the last ten thousand of technology that we invented that we
call money is is responsible for for pretty much everything from from longevity to
to profound altruism to profound uh inequalities that we that we see in our in our world today
while like we said like while there are there are serious uh serious trade negotiations in other
species no other species has managed to uh amplify inequity within itself like human beings
have been able to no other species have been able to invent poverty at the scale that we've been able to uh so and that we have been able to
to manage and maintain through this fiction that we have agreed to uh accept as truth the reason we agree
to accept anything as truth is because we we can attach things to the proximity to our sustenance and satisfaction now
these are two very important uh chapters in human human existence or existence of life uh of any kind so so let's kind
of dial back a lot more because you know these are so many there are so many things to be talked about here
let's dial back to something very very simple or something very sophisticated uh in nature we see tin bergen
uh you know the nobel prize winning scientist that you and i speak about very often again uh did many
sophisticated experiments in understanding behavior in studying ethology and stunning uh human behavior through the lens of studying
behavior in other species so we saw in his experiments he would take a herring bird for example and he would
say he would see that it the herring bird is is is immediately able to recognize its
eggs and hatch the eggs and take care of them now uh nobody nobody seemed to be asking
a very very fundamental question that how does herring girl you know i mean of course tilting bergen these questions were in the air but these were
the first rigorous set of experiments that were conducted in ethology where tin bergen said okay there seems
to be some kind of a stimulus that seems to be some kind of a pattern that the herring girl has to be able to recognize to be able to tell that this
is my egg so say the eggs are of a certain certain texture certain certain color they're
white they have these brown dots on them and tin burger was like what if i make artificial legs what if i'm going to
just take like plaster of paris and like model some eggs and put some brown dots on them will will the you know will this bird be
able to recognize that it's not their eggs and and he was absolutely right the birds were not able to tell
the the artificial legs from the real ones so tin burgund went a little a step further from from there on and said wait
a minute what if i were to amplify these dots and and make the eggs bigger
so you made these really huge eggs with like darker dots with bigger contrast with the base
color and what happened was was was incredible from the point of view of studying human
behavior transformed our understanding of human behavior pretty much permanently and behavior in general permanently as
it turned out the the birds started preferring there are the artificial eggs
or the real ones the supernormal stimulus of these black dots and these
huge eggs created created a created a love pornography of sorts it was it was
isolated and amplified when characteristics were isolated and amplified it created a feedback loop with an algorithmic system that
natural selection has evolved and give given all of us and that's the reason why we have survived in our environments in various contexts
that we look at stimulus from the environment and stimulus is driven by single fingerprints because we don't have time
to process everything so no herring girl processes all the information around it all the context around it
it has to process just the dots on the size of the egg and the bigger the size of the egg the healthier is going to be the
the healthier the the offspring and and hence preferred by the mother so the
the mother immediately starts kind of taking more and more care of these artificial eggs and completely
completely losing sight of of its real legs and this is this and you know that these stories are abundant
in nature we have studied in the last few decades and less and less such stories but the reason we
uh and and the moment we we look at any of these stories i mean the other story that i speak about very
often that you know office um is is that in in in some birds where we have seen that if you
uh birds with lighter plumage uh had had lesser meeting partner success
and the moment you darken the substance uh the the plumage with the lipstick or with some kind of a paint they would suddenly become you
know these rockstars they would become whatever rhythmic portions in their species and they would suddenly
have the most number of mating partners now the reason that would happen again is because um in that particular species
the the saturation of the blemish would be immediately directly linked to the health the genetic health of the
oxidation process or some of the other real physical biological process that gives the individuals their health
and and that's an easy fingerprint to recognize if this individual is healthy or not and that's the same with human human
beings if so i'm going to put two controversial questions for you over here yeah
if a if i said if a couple has three kids are they
likely to care for the one who is going to be more successful
well in humans as it turns out the the the answer is way more complex because firstly humans
have humans have multiple ways of being successful success is no longer only physical
success is no longer only uh only intellectual uh it's a it's a wide variety of
complex math that unravels i mean we are really of the generation where
where uh you know the the nerds have taken over or the jocks and the jocks are you know no longer in positions of power
uh which was which which isn't the case with with uh with apes and still we respond to those stories so yes the
couples will be hijacked by some behaviors there will be one kid who will be cuter than the other there'll be one kid who
would be um but of course they will balance out their expectations and manage their expectations in every way
Human mating philosophies
let's talk about human mating over here why uh like uh
why isn't it just enough to have six-pack and get the meeting success why do we need
to do this elaborate ritual of studying uh making money having wealth have all the
signaling goods to be able to attract uh what is going on over here so likewise it's the same with pretty
much every species again like we were talking about the herring girls in this case and or the or you know wide variety of birds with
damage uh it doesn't end with plummet the the female in most cases sometimes
male even would look at look at the ability to um to negotiate with the environment how good is this
individual at finding the right kind of twigs and stones to build a nest what kind of nest is this individual
building is it safe enough is it secure enough is it is it even beautiful enough because the ability to
produce reduction it may also signal some level of intellect some some level of comprehending the
environment and many people being able to manipulate it so so so so all of these signals all of
these are fingerprints towards recognizing how well is this individual going to be able to and nobody's computing this
consciously so a lot of people start thinking that oh i'm trying to say that the word sitting and thinking that oh this is very nice this will this this
individual will take care of my office no that's what's happening it's already it's already computed for because the individuals the birds that
did not have this computing program in them died off they made the wrong choices so the the
fact that this particular choice making choice architecture exists in this world is through natural selection
it's because it was passed on they they they made the choice and because of that they had more offspring and
that choice architecture passed on to their offspring and lived on the choice architecture that made them choose otherwise died off because they
did not have offspring and did not have meeting uh success so in this case uh like like
we were talking about that we can we can look at stimulus and we can we can this we can see the
response to the stimulus in all the other species but with humans what we have learned to do now imagine uh you know in case of
herring guns there was a there was a really really smart uh you know kunal shah herring girl who who
looked who looked at all these birds getting easily kind of you know attracted to uh
to fake eggs with like you know uh and getting or or looking looking at
these other birds that getting attracted to lipstick drawn uh males and males getting making
success that they would not otherwise have imagined they would they were completely you know they were completely rejected by most females and
suddenly they are like rock stars and kunal is looking at this and saying okay this makes perfect sense why don't i manufacture makeup why don't i
manufacture this little one one dollar fell tip marker that that i will sell to these these males who have been rejected by by
females in their environment and i you know and i'll charge a little penny on that like so all the experimental spend ten years of my life
i can see the long long arc of it i'm doing i'm you know after 10 years of this research i will come up upon this felt tip marker which i'll
sell and i'll take a cent from everyone that's that's a very little amount of money that's a very little amount of i'll take a you
know whatever whatever it is in their economy what is you know whether it's a twig or a stone or you know or food or whatever it is in
that economy and which again by the way gives us a human problem which is holding
most other species cannot hold because most other species deal in in in trade in things that are
perishable humans also trade in perishables but humans have created a metaphor
that stays on that lives on that is imperishable and that is money so that's the other problem with money which is body but we'll come to that in a second
and that allows us to amplify our the effects of our causes at a scale that is that is billion times more than than any animal
can uh but but kudos has sunday selling this one cent fentanyl marker one dollar feltic
marker to millions and millions of balding uh featherless pale feathered males who had
absolutely no mating success and suddenly these are these are to become rock stars and that's why i started to make it make up
industry in a place where it didn't exist now what would what would kunal should do what would quran shall further do
would kind of ensure that they recognize what that is uh kunal shah would also ensure that they when they when
they go out to take a twig the federal market is at the high level you know is place at the eye level and so on and so forth
at every level uh we have recognized that as humans we have recognized that we can nudge we can we can cajole um
in in in non-euphemistic terms manipulate each other's behaviors and we can manipulate human behavior
at a very very vast scale which is no different from from that of a herring girl or that
of of fungi or any other any other species we can manipulate behaviors by changing the
way these stimuli are presented to humans and in what in in the context in the
recipe of these stimuli you can you can isolate the stimuli group them together that's what pornography is
that's what most politics is you you can create you can you can intensify paranoia you can
create the paranoia of the other you can invent the other who's actually who doesn't even exist but you can create through very simple
differences differences of skin color or race or size or body or geography or whatever you
want even a football club which is like as ridiculous as it gets the metaphor you can take something like
that and you can create the other and you can make the other the villainess you can make the other the
one who does not understand whose book is impure who's whose text is impure whose life way of life is wrong and is going to come to
you take away your resources and your meeting partners and you can create holy wars on be on based on these ideas and you get
creative i'm gonna pause you i'm gonna pause you over here two things you talked about yeah first is how is pornography and politics
Similarities between pornography and politics
the same answer second is that talk a little bit
about tribalism you talked about how creating others is the fastest way to create groups
and how systematically humanity has been progressing as well as going back continuously because of this
one phenomena so talk about both of these things okay so let me dial back a lot for that
and come to the first first you know reassurance to the audience
that none of none of the things that i'm saying are prescriptive i'm just treating facts so when i'm saying that there is that
that there is violence or there is extortion or there is uh you know there is there are certain kinds of selfish traits in nature i'm
not prescribing these traits i'm saying that they exist and humans amplify them as well so the human aspiration in fact
if anything has been to transcend nature nature is replete a lot of people a lot of people talk about
going back to nature i think i think we forget that going back to nature means going back to
jungle raj going back to a place where that is replete with murder and violence we only see the generous and
giving part of nature because we're seeing it through our glass doors and our air-conditioned rooms but nature is not anything but just
generous and and giving of course nature is generous in gaming but nature at the same time is repeat with murder and caution
uh when we when we when we walk through a walk through the woods and we listen to the beautiful sound of nature what
we're essentially listening to is millions of animals thirsting for each other's blood
and and calling for for sex that's literally what we are essentially listening for endlessly
and that's that's really it's it's not it's anything but peaceful for for the for the bird who's being chased
for the for the animal that is on the uh whose life is a constant state of threat from predator and constant threat of uh
of uncertainty of its future and future of its progeny it's anything but uh peaceful it's
it's it's a cons it's a constant it's second by second life and death so that's that's really what nature is
now human aspiration is to transcend it human aspiration is to say okay this is where we come from let's
not let's not stay here let's get stuck here let's create a civilization that is more certain that is more equitable you may have you
may have not been gifted the uh the you may not have been gifted the best genes to run really fast
let life not kill you let the jungle not kill you because you may just be the individual you who may invent the cure
to cancer you may be stuck in a wheelchair but you may tell us the meaning of life so let's ensure that every individual
has value and has dignity so human beings over the last 15 20 000 years and
especially in the last three centuries increasingly exponentially created a civilization and if you if you look at if you look at the
definition of a civilization the the finest definition of a civilization for anthropologists is to
look back at any civilization in tribes when you said tribes look back at any tribe or any civilization and see
if the tribe has a femur bond that that is healed if any skeleton is found with a healed
fever bone because if there is a healed femur bone that means that's an advanced civilization that means that
tribe had enough social circumstance had enough social security and safety
that even if an individual was was probably hurt and paralyzed and injured uh they would not die off they would
have enough they would have equity they would have quality they would have sufficient dignity and they would even perhaps reproduce to
live to send their genes forward by the way by that by that standard uh the us is very
quickly rapidly closing towards not being a very advanced civilization by not having that why is
Multi ethnicity - the fastest way to create a chaotic society
multi-ethnicity the fastest way to create a chaotic society not just a chaotic society a variation
is really the the juice the spice of evolution uh the the idea that uh
so why did nature evolve in the way it did there could have been so many strategies why we not all one organism why are there so
many different organisms on this planet now that's that's that's a i'm i'm probably ascribing some kind of teleology to it
by saying why but it's not a why question as much as how question but let's let's just let's just answer that question
nevertheless how is it that there are billions of different kinds of lives on
this planet what what really went on uh over the last three billion years for that to happen
so every time and so first there is death let's kind of accept that that's like that's the basic of it and before
we come to money which is like so far removed now now we come so far into our philosophical metaphysical abstraction
there is death there is radiation there is gravity there is erosion of life life is constantly getting disintegrated on this planet
right it doesn't hold itself together and there are all kinds of reasons why life disintegrates so now
in that situation life evolved or this planet may have evolved multiple strategies of this one strategy survived which is what
we call natural selection which is what we call revolution of life of the many strategies that may or may not have existed this one strategy
prospered the strategy of making copies before it dies every life every individual life aspires
to works hard towards making a copy of its genes and the hen is an egg's way of laying
another egg you are your jeans way of making more
copies of itself you are a machine that the gene makes so that it can make more copies it can you're a replicator
of your genes and that's really how life continues on this planet by making more copies of itself through asexual reproduction or through
sexual reproduction sexual reproduction is a more complex more sophisticated way of transferring genes quickly so that we can evolve
you can have more data so it's a it's an exchange of information if anything about your environment now while it make copies while life make
copy makes copies it it changes it makes a small change it makes a small error each time
it makes a copy of itself because of these these errors every generation has a variation it's a
vast variation so so you have a you know you have a you have a pool of you have a school of
fish one fish would be swimming really really slow and the other would be on the other end of the extreme of being faster let's
say one is like it one swims at eight meters a second the other students are like 11 meters a second and then you have the whole range
of like nine and a half in between around nine and a half in between now now what would largely happen is
nine and a half would survive in that in that context of the environment because the environment has shaped that speed
uh but suddenly small changes in the environment will start create creating more
prosperous opportunities for for the fringes so it may be so that resources start depleting in the
environment and because resources are depleting the one that are used the ones that are using too much speed will start dying off
before they can reproduce but the ones who are conserving energy by being very slow in that environment will start
surviving and prospering and hence saving the copies and sending them forth till it gets slower and slower on the
other hand a predator is introduced in this environment whose that swims at nine and a half so everything nine
and a half men below will start getting eaten up generation after generation so generation after generation anything that's above nine and a half
meters per second will survive and send that algorithm forward and suddenly you'll have a very fast fish that evolves
so that's really that's really natural selection and what and in that a variation is really
the spice of evolution variation allows us the sustainability that we need as a species
that something goes wrong at one level we'll have other software that can take care of the sustenance of the species
likewise we we apply the same kind of variation in in non-biological information so with
human beings now we come to the the biggest leak of human beings and that's where we start kind of closing in
towards money before your audience starts kind of tuning out that the biggest leap for human beings
the biggest the biggest evolutionary relief for human beings is is metaphor
the word elephant is not the elephant and that's profound that's pretty much
almost no other species has has symbolism yep human beings
have the develop the cognitive ability at some point in evolution along the
lines of variation homonyms and human beings and homo sapiens eventually develop the cognitive ability
of assigning of assigning extremely simple science
the science can be oral can be graphic can be can be sculptural can be
can be abstract can be just existing in our heads can be can be or can be verbal can be
conceptual just a sign to to recognize an object
to to codify an object so that information about that object
can be transferred more rapidly so every time i would have to i have to
invoke in you the idea of 30 elephants i don't have to literally hold your hand
and take you to the savannah and wait for 30 elephants to show up
we have created signs like 13 like numbers elephant that that immediately invokes
in you the idea of what an elephant is and through that we can now show each other show each other
30 elephants even without seeing one even without seeing a group of humans now that ability has has created an
exponential leap in in who we are as a species and that separates us from every other species
that is really similarly the the reason why human ever no other tiger like i said
there is there is violence in nature but no other tiger with a wither this switch of a flip of a trigger can kill a
million tigers at one go and and absolutely no other
bonobo can uh can have a can can be altruistic can save the lives or
can alter the lives for for good of a million born over with one good task
whereas humans have that ability we have the ability to do just with one tiny little gesture
alter the lives of millions or billions of humans and somehow and our entire lives go towards
arriving at the place where we have that possibility where we have that that opportunity now now there is again
i'm packing in a lot of lot of stuff here going back to where we were about science the idea that we can assign
symbols to to objects the ability to abstract objects the ability to
map territories the idea that we have these territories that are so vast you know there's a story that i
that i that i speak of very often that an emperor invited a cartographer to map their entire territory and
the cartographer went ahead and mapped the territory and suddenly the trade routes changed and suddenly people became
we started being able to optimize their risks and and all kinds of things changed in their lives they were able to take long short decisions instead of
short-term decisions because of the the ability to be able to see their life from a bird's-eye view but the cartographer was not was not
happy with it so she kept making a map that was finer and finer and more and more intricate and
closer and closer in resemblance to the original territory till it came to be that the map replaced
the kingdom that the map became became so intricate and so rich that people started living
in the map more than they lived in the kingdom and that's really where we arrived now we spend more time on instagram and google and reddit and
wikipedia and and all kinds of online interactions than we do in the real world we have
started living in a map and money is a map of the real world um a map that
that does not necessarily have a very precise legend the legend has has been uh brute force
applied it's it's been it's it's constantly evolving and we're constantly negotiating with nobody sat down at the very beginning
and said this is money and this is the legend this is how it's going to work and that's it no further development it's
that's not how it happened we started with a metaphor we started with a map of a territory and we started playing with the map as if it's a
territory and that that allowed us to arrive at this this madness
where we now have trillions of dollars in abstraction in and it's it's kind of
this faith system where everyone has to sign up for this faith but unlike faith there is no such thing as there's being
secure about money there is no such thing as nation state saying that okay we'll give you the fundamental right to choose your
monetary system uh you know so that's wild but i actually have to switch to
another realistic situation not a metaphor uh which is covered
okay uh uh and i was earlier discussing with you that how covet is actually like poetry
uh which can depending on your receptors stay with you and and once it stays with you can also
transmit from you but it's a nature's version of doing uh some sort of a selection in some ways
Human behaviour around COVID
right it is gonna clean up uh the species in some ways uh can you explain the human behavior
that is going on right now in the world right uh i'm i'm trying to get a lens
from a like is this is this ability to imagine fear has made us worse than we were
and and kind of get into different traps right now for example uh the world has become so much more
efficient because of covert that you're gonna lose so many more jobs uh because the people who have figured out how to be more efficient they don't
need as many people and let's say when you learn to buy online you kind of take away a lot of the jobs in
many many places that you have not even imagined that one behavior shift in you
multiplied by billions of people kind of makes that kind of impact so i'm curious to know from you that
how do you see this virus how do you see it changing the species and and why are we behaving the way we
are behaving right now so here's the thing we know this very
well that this is not the first time in in the history of evolution this is happening this the kind of thing that
goes on all the time this is this isn't this is the kind of thing that happens
billions and billions of times uh across the last three million years it's it's the kind of thing that's going on all the time across all species where uh
where uh where one species hijacks upon the resources of another species and starts kind of
uh eating upon them and uh and the other species fight fights back
now the the fight kind of the the war between these two species and the negotiation between these two species
lasts generations till it reaches some kind of a till it reaches some kind of a of a stasis of
some kind it reaches either a symbiosis it reaches a and a constant uh constant pull and push
of a parasitic um or a host relationship uh or it reaches some kind of a trigrophic relationship
like like in in we see that in trees that trees give out signals to the to their
predators predator to call a pawn and hunt upon their predators so the trees will send out
signals to to carnivores to come and hunt upon the herbivores that are that are eating them up
so all kinds of tritopic interactions emerge from these kind of these kind of interactions and and
humans have evolutionarily faced
multiple multiple uh pathogens why do we know that because we have disgust if we
that's the historical record of the kind of pathogens we have faced in the past it's a it's a it's a live history
document in our in our life in our behavior that is uh that that shows us the kind of pathogens
we have we have been able to we have encountered and survived in the past why does disgust tell us that
look at the world look at what the behavior of disgust is look it takes something really really pungent and and and
something that is that is that is decomposing and expose that
expose a human being to them your immediate reaction would be to spit would be to to to put your hand over your nose
making a mask basically and brace yourself or remove yourself from from that
position immediately we call we have a name for this experience we have called this emotion disgust what this emotion essentially is
it's a it's it's really it's really a software market in dread it's a high priority software with a high priority response
it it's looking at potential infection in your body and it's stopping that infection it's stopping the influx of
that infection immediately by by creating a mask by moving yourself by spitting out any kind of consumption
or or engagement that may have happened and moving yourself from the source if possible now this is this is our uh this is our
ppe kit that we have been evolving why do we have this pva kit why do we have this mask why do we have this
behavior of creating a mask immediately because the the ones who did not got infected and died off before they could
reproduce again that's through natural selection that we have so we have in our past
survived endless pathogens the ones every human being who's alive is is a
consequence of the ones who have survived endless pathogens the ones who did not survive
who did not have the strategies that we that some humans had developed died off for the last century we
uh we have not seen big evolutionary events in human civilization
because we have we have transmuted we have transposed in a way are evolutionary needs to
non-biological situations how have we done that by taking care of the needy by
ensuring that more and more human beings don't have to die from from
from not having access to resources by ensuring that more and more human beings don't have to
don't have their genes lost at the at not finding meeting partners we have created institutions we have
created all kinds of uh we we've created all kind of energy systems where
where the flow of energy is more certain than it was in in forest and southern environments thereby maintaining that
more human beings will be taken care of and will will have the opportunity to reproduce and take care of their progeny
and by and by doing that we have removed the the pressures of natural selection and
created a certain stasis in human evolution this is a so this is not what we what we
were living was an unnatural event and by the way by unnatural i mean a good thing a lot of people start
thinking that if i'm saying unnatural i'm trying to prescribe them we need to go back to some i want to maintain over and over again
that i i prescribe to this this human natural and not exactly unnatural but this
this human interfered in nature uh with with more and more enlightenment that's a kind of that's what i'm if i if
anything i'm prescribing to that or pure natural your pre-human natural so what i'm saying is that yes it's a good
thing that we we aspire to a state of civilization where we take care of more and more people where we create
equitable resources for everyone that we where we come together and create more and more certainty for more and more
kinds of life versus they're not being certainty but this is nature nature is going to keep throwing uh
throwing at us all kinds of uncertainties because that's what nature is nature is going to have these like
very beautifully eloquently said a virus is a piece of poetry it's a piece of an algorithm and
that's that's absolutely right what kind of viruses do we see in human behaviors you know we've seen all kinds of viruses
in in our behaviors that have that that sustain we see people dying i
mean viruses though not the only thing that kills us in fact if anything if you look around uh it's it's um
it's bad ideas that that humans are willing to kill each other or all the time it's be or it's uh it's
the it's the attachment to an idea good bad ugly whatever it is it's the it's a profound attachment to
the idea that this particular idea is going to give you and your progeny and your entire gene pool
uh an infinite success at uh at this genetic race not in this life in an
afterlife even you'll have you know you'll have endless opportunities to have have virgin meeting partners if anything you would
you know there are all kinds of ideas that are that are that are promised as an offering to you to be willing to
put your life at stake to be willing to and and we are willing to die for these ideas we are willing to be willing to
die for the ideas that that give us any kind of hope that there is going to be transcendence that something about us is
going to live on or something about our progeny is going to live on and these ideas don't limit themselves to religion these ideas could be
nationalism it could be patriotism it could be they could be they could manifest in many many forms
and we are willing to live and die for these ideas uh so the relationship between ideas and
humans is not very different from the from biological algorithms like like pathogens bacteria
good bacteria gut bacteria or bad bacteria pathogen producing bacteria and and
humans as well so that's that's really the natural that's really how nature works it it throws pieces together and some
species find a way to live together some species try to live off each other some kill off each other and and that's
really where we are at we are too large we are too vast a species too complex species
and two powerful species to really be uh to really i mean to really be
caged by the virus or to be brought to our knees by the virus as as we we imagined it has been
uh we are we are you know like every other species we we we are lost ours we uh in fact
from from from whatever little economics i know uh ganymen and uh uh economists of the last
couple of decades did the math and figured out that a loss hurts 2.25
point times more than uh then then the good stuff gives you pleasure so we
are here lost ours for that very reason and uh and hence we are cautious we have these smoke alarms that go off and these
smoke alarms cause causes chronic pain that causes anxiety that causes depression but that's and those are the seven times
when the smoke alarms are wrong but the three times that the smoke alarms are right they save our lives so so we are hence a paranoid species we
are extremely cautious we have lost ours we do not want to take too many chances we want to air towards caution
and that's the reason why we have this discourse of um of taking and we also want to take care
of our of remember the first premise of civilization that we want to take care of everyone we do not want to lose too
many of our numbers we do not want to lose out on our variation because it is our variation it is the vast variety of human beings that have
come together and given us the solutions to to to sustain and to invent longevity today
so if you if you look at the if you look at the singular signs of longevity you would see that contributions have come from you
know all skin colors all regions all kinds of people all kinds of minds
all kinds of genders and all kinds of human beings all kinds of physical and mental and intellectual abilities have all come
together towards creating this this life of greater certainty of greater freedom of greater longevity of greater tools
and that's why we want that variation to exist it has been successful for us in the past we want this variation to not
go away but also we want to create a future for our children which has more certainty we don't know we know that genes are a lottery we know
that we our own genes can can produce a progeny two or three generations later
that that may that may need the system way more than we do we may be extremely
well equipped to to deal with the to deal with the environment as is we may we may you know we may be gifted
intellectually physically to prosper but if we do not create a system that
produces prosperity for everyone uh our genetic lineage may suffer so we
also want certainty for our for for virginia and for our future which is a collective which makes our aspiration collective which
are makes uh which makes our selfish selfishness a collective selfishness on that note of selfishness and uh
progeny what's your view on designer babies we are going to soon
Anand's view on 'designers babies'
have ability to edit genes through advanced technologies like crispr and maybe even more advanced
technologies and very soon we'll be able to create babies that are more good looking have better hair uh
have skin that is better probably intelligence that is better i i i did my own genetic tests and one
of the traits was uh about uh courage uh they had a marker for that as well which
was pretty interesting and and they also had a marker for not being
able to not get addicted right so i have a marker which has a thing where i'm less likely to get addicted to let's
say narcotic substances or alcohol or any of that and i was quite surprised to know about these things
what's your view when you do human will humans lack up designer babies like the bird
or are we going to be consciously thinking about this and worrying about it
here's the beautiful fact about this canal we've always had designer babies
[Laughter]
of attracting meeting partners whether through whether through six
packs or through six brains or six processes in your brain or whatever it is or six million dollars
whatever that is or whether or through the through the ability to showcase that you have the resources to
sustain and and buy more more sustaining resources whether whether through the ability to
whatever that whatever it is that you you said courage you know as a marker you said again through courage through the
ability to show that you have the the ability to take big risks and hence produce big gains
for your progeny whatever it is that you that we have looked at each looked for in our
partners that is the that has been a process of making designer babies all
all attraction all love all romance has been if in anything a process of making designer babies this is the kind of
child i want i want an artist's child i want an incl i'm sepia sexual i want an intellectual's child
you know the presumption there we have that that we have of course had to rely on is the inaccuracy
of what happens when when dominant and and uh dormant genes collide
we still buying into some some semblance of a lottery two of the smartest people can come together and the dominant gene in the
progeny may not necessarily be intellectual intellectual uh um expression or intellectual
maybe you know maybe courage or maybe loyalty or maybe uh maybe all tourism or maybe empathy
maybe it's maybe something else uh you know a wide variety of uh so there is one one and and the other
thing is that humans are extremely complex as as as we know that we we're not only
made of all genetic programming we are made up of a mix of genetic programming what happens in the first 24
what happens in the pregnancy state what happens in the first 24 months of our child
and the physical shape of the prefrontal cortex the nutrition of the time the environment of the time the amount of violence and threat at the time
all kinds of responses create create switches create triggers where where
some genes are manifest or others some genes are taken up or or others and through your lifetime you
you have the ability to in fact transform in that sense um epigenetically if not genetically you
can transform as a person profoundly not just not just in the way you have designed your behavior through your
learned experience but at a far more profound level depending on experiences that could be
dramatic or it could be extremely gratifying depending on wide variety of experiences you may you may find
yourself in in in a wide variety of situations where your where your profound default personality
may switch because of the genes including in some cases even i cannot so
uh so so the the the fact is that we have forever been designing babies
we are going to do that with more precision and with amplification now the challenge with humans when we talk
about all kind of human intervention the only thing that we need to be very cautious of is amplification humans have the ability to amplify anything
because of this this metaphorical system this non-biological system that we we didn't get much time to talk go into
today because there's just so much to talk about this subject i mean you've really taken the most sophisticated piece of an
essay that can be which is uh the biology of money it's like that that really can't be a more more complex sophisticated piece of
study of inquiry that i i'm telling you this is easily the most complex piece of inquiry
that exists probably which is the biology of a mimetic system that we have agreed to
live by that there is proximity to sustenance and satisfaction to such a vast degree that
if you have this metaphor if you bought into this metaphor and if you have these these metaphorical uh ones and
zeroes in in that abstract cloud where everyone has agreed upon putting those ones and zeros in and
it's literally happening happening at a complete abstract space you don't even see it anymore i mean we have even moved past from cash money and
plastic money we are in we're in cryptocurrency it's once and zeros it's completely it's completely metaphorized that it's
like it's completely achieved it's precision in metaphor and and based on that metaphor you can you can trade in futures you can
you can give each other you can give each other you can give each other assurances promises you can you can simulate more
and more features and and then accumulate those simulated futures you can equate the past
you said it's a battery but no it's not only a battery it's a it's a simulation it's a it's a bloody time machine it's
it's uh you are you're accumulating fast as a storage and a battery system and passing it on along with your
uh along with genetic lines or along with whatever lines culture lines and the same time you're accumulating
the future and putting it right there right right into this this machine that's becoming exponential
and we don't have any rules for it anything imagine biology of credit that is
each other that someday in the future we will mind the resources of a of a steady-state uh energy planet by
the way this planet has the same amount of fossil it's going to not it's not going to change it's going to capture the same amount of sun's energy
and we're going to capture more and more of it as as our technologies improve we're going to produce some some semblance of
of abundance for a short phase where we're going to capture as much of sun's energy as we can and that's that's going to also reach a
limit so in a steady state planet we have ascribed an infinite value uh so you know our
our mutual friend sameer gave me gave me a beautiful metaphor for this he's around take this apple you know and
start slicing it how many slices can you make of an apple and i said you know uh it will stop somewhere and
it's like where where will you not be able to make any further slices of this apple uh i said you know the where the slice
of the apple is the same as the edge of the knife i mean when it when it's exactly the edge of the knife you cannot make any more
slices so fantastic okay now take a virtual apple you know and take a virtual life which has been
coated with one rule that it can every time it has to slice it can make us make an edge that's thinner
than the wedge of the apple now how many slices can you make you're making infinite number of slices
and that's really what's happened with money we've been making an infinite number of slices which do not correspond
to the real apple out there along with that we have a lot of other problems we you
know the last century of economics we imagined economies economies to be a very rational
field of of inquiry you know uh we we we assume that we are not lost ours we
assumed in fact in many times that we we are not even that we have self-control we don't have self-control we have seen
in so many experiments now so many subsequent experiments that we that the children will you know much rather take the marshmallow that's
available right now yeah where you are giving them the you know the promise that i'll give you a marshmallow 20 minutes i'll give you
20 minutes later they will just like pick up the one right now so most human beings behave in that way they do not their lost hours
and they do not necessarily have self-control they do not have the ability to simulate futures and be able to predict those features
for themselves um then there is hoarding that that happens in like we were saying in fungi as well fungi so fungi and plant roots have this
relationship they have a very very complex trade stock market like you know um
so fungi basically take resources take nutrition and supply the nutrition to plants and plant roots give give the fungi the
carbon the carbon due to which is the the source we are all carbon these light forms so plant
plants give fungi carbon and fungi take uh all the nutrition from from around
plants and there is eve 80 of the plants on this planet like weeds and trees and
shrubs and fruit and vegetables everything that you that you walk away all the plants that you see around you
have this underground stock market run by a complex cloud of fungi
that that manage the entire plant economy now another fungi of course like human stock
market do the same thing that they have developed the same kind of strategies so they what do what do they do they plug into
the plant roots and stop the plant roots from being able to find their own nutrition
so they make the plants completely dependent on themselves and then they start holding this
nutrition within their own clouds within their own networks and they bump up the prices
through creating artificial scarcity and and hence demand more carbon from plants
for nutrition that plants would have been able to buy for much lesser carbon and in that it creates creates a
monetary system that is not visible but that is invisibly implicit it's not explicit like humans but it's implicit
in that in the change of butter in the change of the rate of part the butter is not consistent in a classical butter one would you
imagine that one you know one cow would be whatever 10 kgs of rice consistently across the bone like or whatever 200 kgs
of rice across the board more or less with like a little bit of demand supply changing based on scarcity in the in the in the
localized environment but here through hoarding it fungi learned to create artificial scarcity and so do the
plants plants also do the same thing plants in fact completely paris became parasitical to do a lot of fungi like orchids for
example do that with fungi so we know we know that these systems exist in every other species but humans have
Money: Now a metaphor in human society!
managed to by creating this metaphor of money and creating these arbitrary rules around this metaphor you know what are
the rules around this metaphor really i mean i've spoken to economists and i'm you know you you are you you are an economist as well and so
many of my friends are are great thinkers of of of finance and and have taken up this game of finance
even that that you know that you uh you you very happily play and enjoy even
and and you know very few will will actually i mean are common friends uh very few of our
common friends will actually truly be able to give a very satisfactory answer to what these rules are here what are the true rules of this
metaphor what are the true rules of this board game they're not even consistent we keep changing them we keep ordering them
and we keep realizing only retrospectively that we screwed up that we that sub that subprime could not
possibly make any sense you can't take a bubble and make another bubble bigger bubble on top of it like it just doesn't make any sense how can this add this metaphorical value
which is like you said a battery suddenly become a time machine it just keeps changing form it's not
it's i mean in in writing in if i were to create a universe and if a writer had created a created an
allegory that kept changing shapes so often i would call that call that an inconsistent universe i would say that
this is not going to become harry potter you know you need to kind of remove this you need to change this that's that's the level of inconsistency this metaphor
has shown that that we are able to pull and and most of financial institutions of the
day are just designed towards finding these loopholes loopholes and the rules within this metaphor
within their the metaphorical systems so that some who managed to find the loopholes within
the back door within these these computing systems can suddenly exponentially change the number
without anything changing i mean fluctuations in stock market companies do not make profits and losses
we are not we are not actually you know what what is happening when billions of dollars are disappearing every day in stock market what is
happening when when suddenly they reappear you know the the same amount of services and goods are not really appearing in in human
potential so where is that money actually coming so it's no longer battery it's it's it's it's it's responding to
it's responding to something extremely vestigial and irrational the human sentiment there is nothing
more irrational than the human sentiment and and the human sentiment is
is responding constantly to these manipulations that some people hack into it done through marketing done through
creating paranoia done through creating uh needs that that are not even essential needs done through creating
needs of of buying uh a piece of conceptual inquiry at the price of four crore
kilograms of rice um we we can we can manipulate each other endlessly
towards creating these necessities towards creating these needs and that sentiment starts reflecting at
a moment by moment basis on this on this really large scale metaphor that we've all agreed
uh to to have faith in anan we can go on and on for the whole
day but end this session so that we do another session very soon thank you so much for doing this every time it's
fun every time it opens up my brain to new possibilities new thinking new connections thank you
so much for doing this uh over to you uh uh and thank you thank you so much hey i want to make one last
point one last point yeah one last point you know i was thinking about this this morning again
and something else occurred to me about about um how most money is can be made by by
tapping into these irrationalities and tapping into into the uh into the human ability
to respond in a vestigial manner respond in a manner that we are still stuck in positions give an example give an example yeah so i'll give you an
example the example is this that why is it that tim berners-lee
the man who revolutionized life for an entire civilization history is not going to be the same ever again just because
this one man invented the internet is why is it that tim berners-lee is
what somewhere between 10 to 20 million dollars and the and the guy who coded the
software that can that that that boys can look at girls
and say if they are hot or not and is is is one of the richest people on the planet there is something
about uh this this metaphorical system where where it's not about true saving
of time again that that battery example is great and that's the most tempting one and
i am personally of course very serious by the idea that that money is virtual battery where you store
time saved not only from your life but from the life of every person that you have saved life off but by that logic tim berners-lee should be the most
rich person on the on the planet while he's not and i'm i'm not so sure if he cares so much but that's not the
point my point is that the most amount of money we are seeing can be made
by playing into the irrationalities of people by putting objects at a certain eye level by creating hyper super normal stimulus
and creating and manipulating people's responses by creating michael bay films by creating junk food
by creating mcdonald's burgers by creating stimuli that create very strong responses in you
of joy or pleasure of of anger of paranoia or fear and by creating this extremely intense
manipulating this extremely intense and rather irrational senses sensitive since central mentalities you
can make the you can make the most amount of money dude a lot of things to think about
uh i'm going to ask you to conclude otherwise the session can go on and on uh and anand and i uh every time we've
met each other for a one-hour meeting it's usually been a whole day so over to you
thank you so much i think none of us really wanted this conversation to end either but
i do understand limitations of time um but the great thing is this conversation is going to be available
for everyone to watch right after this live stream because there was just so much that was unraveled with this
conversation i think we'll be going back to it again and again to learn something new thank you anand thank you kunal for your
time uh it was great having you and it was great listening to or the generous knowledge that was
