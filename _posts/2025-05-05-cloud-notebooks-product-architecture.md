# Requirements for Jupyter Notebook Server Implementation

## Core Functionality
1. Create a Jupyter notebook-based server that allows local development with remote execution
2. Support Python notebooks only
3. Enable notebooks to run as jobs on EC2 instances
4. Support both foreground (interactive) and background job execution modes

## EC2 Instance Management
1. Spin up and terminate EC2 instances dynamically per job
2. Each notebook job runs on a single EC2 instance (no multi-node clusters)
3. No persistent pool of EC2 instances needed
4. No auto-scaling or spot instance optimization required initially

## Job Execution Features
1. Provide real-time monitoring of logs and outputs during job execution
2. Allow users to assign notebooks to specific EC2 instance types
3. Support both interactive and background execution modes

## User Interface & API
1. Expose an API and UI for job scheduling and management
2. Enable viewing of execution logs
3. Provide job management controls (start, stop, schedule)

## Authentication & Security
1. Implement role-based access control for users submitting jobs
2. Secure API endpoints and notebook execution environment

## Data Storage
1. Store job outputs in MongoDB (not S3)
2. Persist notebooks and execution results for future reference

## Architecture Pattern
1. Follow Databricks-like job execution model
2. Support local development workflow with remote execution capability
