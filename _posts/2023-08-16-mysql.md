* `CREATE USER 'airbyte'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_plugin BY 'password';`
* `CREATE DATABASE airbyte`
* `GRANT PRIVILEGE ON airbyte.* TO 'airbyte'@'host';`
* `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

There is one more setting I don't remember. Look for Airbyte errors, when connecting to mysql, and set the setting globally.
