“Top picks for books in the life sciences”

Non-Amazon links are better, but options are important. I might add blurbs to this myself, but it will certainly come horribly slowly.

Micheal Levin Says:
* “There are many more good ones, I had to make hard choices to get it to a manageable number. Not saying I agree with everything in every book - these are ones that stretch thinking in useful ways.”
* “Some are very old; they have important ideas you will not find in modern sources. I will also put this list up on my website and add to it. Possibly links will be added later, and eventually some top picks in other fields as well. Sorry, I know it would be great to have a blurb [for] each one; I just don't have the time. In no particular order:”
