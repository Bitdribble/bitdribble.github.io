Q: Which Vue frameworks do you recommend, for a web site that implements tables, charts, rule-based processes, and needs to support different logins and different permission levels. My back end is MongoDB and Databricks.

For a Vue.js-based web application that requires complex functionalities like tables, charts, rule-based processes, and different login and permission levels, alongside a backend comprised of MongoDB and Databricks, selecting a robust and versatile Vue framework and additional libraries is crucial for efficient development. Here are my recommendations for frameworks and libraries that cater to these needs:

#### Vue.js Frameworks

* `Vue CLI`: This is not a framework per se but a standard tooling baseline for Vue applications. Starting with Vue CLI allows you to scaffold a new project and select plugins for routing, state management, and more. It's essential for setting up your project structure efficiently.

* `Vuetify`: An excellent framework that provides a vast array of UI components that are ready to use, including tables and potentially elements that could be used for charts. It's built on top of Vue.js and integrates well with other libraries and plugins. Vuetify also supports accessibility standards and responsive design out of the box, making it a solid choice for creating rich, interactive user interfaces.

* `Quasar Framework`: A powerful Vue.js framework that allows you to build responsive websites, PWAs, SSR applications, mobile apps (using Cordova or Capacitor for native apps), and Electron apps, all from the same codebase. It includes a wide variety of pre-built material components that can make the development of tables, charts, and more, much faster and easier.

#### State Management
* `Vuex`: For managing state across your app, especially when dealing with different permission levels and ensuring that the UI reacts dynamically to changes in user status or data updates.

#### Charts and Data Visualization
* Vue `Chart.js` or Vue `ApexCharts`: Both are excellent libraries for integrating charts into your Vue.js applications. They offer a wide range of chart types and are relatively easy to integrate and customize within Vue components.

#### Authentication and Authorization
* `Vue Auth`: A plugin that handles authentication and authorization. It supports multiple strategies and can be integrated with your backend for handling different logins and permission levels.

#### Backend Integration
For MongoDB and Databricks integration, you'll likely be interfacing through a custom API layer. Ensure your Vue application can communicate effectively with your backend through libraries like Axios for making HTTP requests.

#### Additional Considerations
* `Vue Router`: For handling navigation within your application, especially important for apps with multiple user roles and permission levels to manage access to different parts of the application.

* `Environment Variables`: Use environment variables (e.g., via a .env file) to manage different configurations for development, testing, and production environments, especially important for managing database connections and API endpoints securely.

Given your application's complexity, focusing on a modular architecture where components are reusable and services are well-separated is crucial. This approach will make it easier to manage and scale your application as it grows. Moreover, consider implementing a robust testing strategy, including unit tests and end-to-end tests, to ensure the reliability and security of your application, especially in handling different user roles and permissions.
