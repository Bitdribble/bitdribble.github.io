#### LinkedIn recommendation ask template

Hi {{clientName}},

Hope you are doing well.

I have a quick favor to ask.

Would you be willing to write a brief testimonial about your experience with me so I can add it to our list of happy customers?

Nothing super long. Just a few sentences describing your experience with me.

Prospective customers don't care so much about what I say about my services, but they do care what our customers like you have to say.

All you have to do is simply write your testimonial here - <Linked recommendations link>

Would you be willing to do that?

Thanks so much, {{clientName}}
