Q: With pipenv, how do I save dependencies in Pipfile?

---

To save dependencies in a `Pipfile` using `pipenv`, you can use the `pipenv install` command followed by the package names or requirements file. Here's the step-by-step process:

* Activate your project's virtual environment by navigating to your project's directory in the terminal and running the command:

```shell
pipenv shell
```

1. Install the desired packages or dependencies using `pipenv install`. You have a few options here:
  a. Install individual packages:

  ```shell
  pipenv install package_name1 package_name2 ...
  ```

  b. Install packages from a requirements file (`requirements.txt`):

  ```shell
  pipenv install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  c. Install packages from a `Pipfile.lock` (if it exists) and update the Pipfile accordingly: `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile`. The `--ignore-pipfile` flag tells pipenv to ignore the existing `Pipfile` and only consider the `Pipfile.lock` for installation.

2. After running one of the above pipenv install commands, `pipenv` will automatically update the `Pipfile` in your project directory with the installed dependencies and their respective versions.

The Pipfile will have a section `[packages]` where the installed packages are listed with their versions.

For example:

```toml
[packages]
requests = "==2.26.0"
numpy = "==1.21.0"
```

Optionally, you can also specify additional settings or constraints for your dependencies in the `Pipfile`. For example, you can set a minimum required version or specify a specific version range. You can manually edit the Pipfile using a text editor to add these settings.

Here's an example of specifying a minimum version for a package:

```toml
[packages]
requests = ">2.25.0"
```

Once you've made the necessary changes, save the `Pipfile`.

That's it! The `Pipfile` will now contain the list of your project's dependencies along with their versions.
