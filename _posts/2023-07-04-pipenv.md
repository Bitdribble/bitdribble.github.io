#### How to save dependencies

To save dependencies in a `Pipfile` using `pipenv`, you can use the `pipenv install` command followed by the package names or requirements file. Here's the step-by-step process:

* Activate your project's virtual environment by navigating to your project's directory in the terminal and running the command:

    ```shell
    pipenv shell
    ```

* Install the desired packages or dependencies using `pipenv install`. You have a few options here:

    * Install individual packages:
    ```shell
    pipenv install package_name1 package_name2 ...
    ```

    * Install packages from a requirements file (`requirements.txt`):
    ```shell
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    * Install packages from a `Pipfile.lock` (if it exists) and update the Pipfile accordingly:
    ```shell
    pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
    ```

        The `--ignore-pipfile` flag tells pipenv to ignore the existing `Pipfile` and only consider the `Pipfile.lock` for installation.

* After running one of the above pipenv install commands, `pipenv` will automatically update the `Pipfile` in your project directory with the installed dependencies and their respective versions.

* The Pipfile will have a section `[packages]` where the installed packages are listed with their versions. For example:

    ```toml
    [packages]
    requests = "==2.26.0"
    numpy = "==1.21.0"
    ```

* Optionally, you can also specify additional settings or constraints for your dependencies in the `Pipfile`. For example, you can set a minimum required version or specify a specific version range. You can manually edit the Pipfile using a text editor to add these settings.

    Here's an example of specifying a minimum version for a package:

    ```toml
    [packages]
    requests = ">2.25.0"
    ```

    Once you've made the necessary changes, save the `Pipfile`.


That's it! The `Pipfile` will now contain the list of your project's dependencies along with their versions.

#### How to lock dependencies

* Once you have your Pipfile with the desired dependencies, run the following command to generate the Pipfile.lock:

    ```bash
    pipenv lock
    ```

    This command will analyze the `Pipfile`, resolve the dependency graph, and produce a lock file that specifies the exact versions of all installed packages, as well as their dependencies.

    The `Pipfile.lock` file will be generated in your project's directory. It is recommended to commit this file to version control (e.g., `Git`) along with your code. This allows you and your team to have reproducible builds with consistent dependency versions.

* Whenever you install or update packages using `pipenv`, it will consult the `Pipfile.lock` to ensure that the same versions of packages are installed, providing consistency across different development environments.

* By regularly running pipenv lock and committing the updated `Pipfile.lock`, you can maintain a reliable and reproducible dependency environment for your project.
