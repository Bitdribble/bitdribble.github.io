These are inspired and borrow code from:
- STAT 453: Deep Learning (Spring 2021)
- Instructor: Sebastian Raschka (sraschka@wisc.edu)
- Course [web site](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~sraschka/teaching/stat453-ss2021/), [github](https://github.com/rasbt/stat453-deep-learning-ss21)

The worksheets described below are in Andrei's [github fork](https://github.com/andrei-radulescu-banu/stat453-deep-learning-ss21). They are ported to `torch 1.13` and are using `torchdata` loaders:
- [LSTM](https://github.com/andrei-radulescu-banu/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/blob/main/L15/lstm.ipynb)
- [Packed LSTM](https://github.com/andrei-radulescu-banu/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/blob/main/L15/packed_lstm.ipynb)
- [Packed GRU](https://github.com/andrei-radulescu-banu/stat453-deep-learning-ss21/blob/main/L15/packed_gru.ipynb)
