In a recent episode of Lenny's podcast, Lenny had the pleasure of sitting down with Kunal Shah, the CEO and founder of CRED, a leading FinTech startup in India valued at over $6 billion. Kunal is a renowned entrepreneur and product leader with a massive following on social media, where he shares profound insights on business, product development, and life. With a background in philosophy, Kunal brings a unique perspective to the tech world, which was evident throughout their conversation. They dove deep into the nuances of building successful products in India, the success of Indian CEOs in the U.S., and the unique challenges and opportunities within the Indian startup ecosystem.

## The Delta 4 Framework: A Blueprint for Success

Kunal introduced his Delta 4 framework, a simple yet powerful concept for evaluating product success. Unlike the vague notion of a product needing to be "10x better," the Delta 4 framework offers a measurable benchmark. Kunal explained that when a product's efficiency score is at least four points higher than its predecessor (on a scale of 1 to 10), it achieves three critical outcomes:

1. **Irreversibility**: Users won't revert to the old solution.
2. **High Tolerance for Failure**: Users are more forgiving of minor issues.
3. **Unique Brag-worthy Proposition (UBP)**: Users can't stop talking about it, leading to organic growth with low or zero customer acquisition costs (CAC).

For example, Kunal compared the efficiency of taking a cab (rated a 3) to using Uber (rated a 9), illustrating a Delta 4+ product that transformed user behavior. Conversely, he noted that buying a suit online versus offline often fails to achieve this delta, resulting in a reversible product with low user tolerance. This framework, rooted in Kunal's philosophical musings and inspired by concepts like entropy and evolutionary biology, is a practical tool for founders to assess whether their product will resonate in the market.

## Why Indian CEOs Thrive in the U.S.

One of the most striking parts of the discussion was about the success of Indian-born CEOs leading major U.S. companies like Microsoft (Satya Nadella), Alphabet (Sundar Pichai), Adobe, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, and even Starbucks. Kunal attributes this phenomenon to a combination of factors:

- **Immigrant Hunger**: Indian immigrants often come from humble backgrounds with no privilege, driving a relentless work ethic and a chip on their shoulder to succeed.
- **Cultural Emphasis on Logic and Math**: India's societal appreciation for engineering and logic creates a strong foundation for technical and analytical roles.
- **Adherence to 'Dharma'**: Drawing from Indian mythology, Kunal explained that these CEOs embody the qualities of Vishnu, the god of sustenance, maintaining the core principles (or "dharma") of the companies they lead. Unlike founders (Brahma, the creator) or disruptors (Shiva, the destroyer), these CEOs excel at scaling and sustaining, balancing high values with strategic adaptability.

Kunal highlighted a two-by-two framework of values and obedience, positioning successful Indian CEOs as oscillating between Rama (high values, high obedience) and Krishna (high values, low obedience). This balance allows them to uphold a company's core ethos while innovating strategically, as seen in Satya Nadella's handling of the OpenAI crisis.

## Navigating India's Unique Market Dynamics

Building products in India requires a fundamentally different approach from Western markets. Kunal outlined several key distinctions:

### DAUs vs. ARPU: The Indian Paradox

India's low per capita income (around $2,500 annually) makes it challenging to generate high average revenue per user (ARPU), even as daily active users (DAUs) skyrocket due to cheap data and high smartphone penetration. Global giants like Meta may boast millions of users in India but struggle to monetize them effectively, with ARPU as low as $3–$4 per user annually. This dynamic forces Indian startups to focus on scale and explore multiple revenue streams rather than relying on high ARPU.

### The Perception of Time

Kunal shared a fascinating insight: "No Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life." Unlike in the U.S., where hourly wages instill a tangible sense of time's value, Indian culture lacks this concept. Many Indian languages don't even have a word for "efficiency." This affects consumer behavior, with users prioritizing cost savings over time savings, making it harder to monetize time-based services like subscriptions.

### Low Trust Markets and the Power of Super Apps

India, like many developing nations, is a low-trust market where consumers are wary of new brands due to weak institutional protections. This leads to a concentration of trust in established brands, giving rise to super apps and conglomerates like Tata, which spans industries from salt to cars. Kunal noted that in low-trust markets, brand reputation is paramount, and startups must build trust before expecting consumer adoption.

### The Curse of Focus

In contrast to the U.S. mantra of "focus on one thing," Kunal argues that focus is a curse in Asian markets. With low ARPU, startups must diversify offerings to maximize revenue. Additionally, in low-trust environments, consumers gravitate toward brands that do many things well, reinforcing the super app model.

## Challenges and Opportunities in India's Startup Ecosystem

India's startup scene is vibrant and full of potential, but it faces unique challenges:

- **Risk Aversion**: India's long-term, collectivist culture makes it risk-averse, with failure (e.g., startup layoffs) often stigmatized. Kunal noted that a failed founder may struggle to find a spouse due to societal perceptions of risk-taking.
- **Low Female Labor Participation**: With one of the lowest female labor participation rates globally, India has an opportunity to leverage AI and remote work to create new economic opportunities for women.
- **Youthful Demographics**: India's young, tech-savvy population is a massive asset, but as the first generation to embrace entrepreneurship, they are still learning to navigate risk and failure.

Kunal sees AI as a double-edged sword: it can democratize expertise and boost productivity, but rapid automation could disrupt jobs if India doesn't adapt quickly. He advocates for making AI proficiency a baseline requirement for all roles, ensuring the workforce remains competitive.

## Lessons from Building CRED

Kunal's journey with CRED, which processes over 20% of India's credit card bill payments, offered valuable lessons:

- **Target the Right Audience**: CRED focused on India's top 25 million families, who have higher per capita income and global tastes, rather than chasing China's population-driven scale.
- **Evolving as a Founder**: Zero-to-one skills don't automatically translate to scaling from 10 to 100. Founders must adapt, balancing creativity with stability to meet the expectations of growth-stage investors.
- **Uncertainty Absorption**: Kunal views founders as "uncertainty absorbers" for employees, investors, and customers, a role that becomes more demanding as a company scales.

## The Power of Curiosity and Second-Order Thinking

Kunal emphasized curiosity as a cornerstone of growth, likening it to a willingness to embrace problems without clinging to expertise. He shared an example of asking ChatGPT about animals that survived over 100 million years, revealing traits like adaptability, high conversion rates, and metabolic flexibility—qualities startups can emulate.

He also championed second-order thinking, the ability to predict the ripple effects of decisions. Kunal recommends asking "why" questions to foster this mindset, such as exploring the historical origins of everyday objects or societal practices. For example, asking kids "Why do humans wear jewelry?" encourages deep, historical analysis that builds critical thinking.

## Contrarian Views and Life Lessons

In the "contrarian corner" segment, Kunal shared his belief that wealth is stored energy, not a zero-sum game. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have converted energy (kinetic, solar, etc.) into wealth, and AI and nuclear fission will amplify this. He argues that chasing wealth equality is futile; instead, creating abundant wealth benefits everyone.

Reflecting on failure, Kunal shared that his family's financial crisis at age 15 shaped his drive to succeed. He views failure as a daily reality for entrepreneurs, but one that teaches resilience and lessons worth sharing.

## Final Thoughts

Kunal's insights offer a masterclass in understanding India's startup landscape and the broader dynamics of building impactful products. His Delta 4 framework, philosophical lens, and emphasis on curiosity and second-order thinking are universally applicable, whether you're in Bengaluru or Silicon Valley. For aspiring founders, Kunal's advice is clear: embrace risk, learn from failure, and share your learnings to democratize knowledge.
