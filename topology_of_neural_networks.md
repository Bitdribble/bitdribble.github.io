* [Topological Deep Learning: Classification Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08354.pdf), M. Hajij, K. Istvan (2020) - very basic explanation of how NNs are approvximator functions, with good bibliography
* [Reviews: Topological Distances and Losses for Brain Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08623.pdf), M. K. Chang, A. Smith, G. Siu (2021). This is a survey of loss functions for Neural Nets used in brain imaging - showing how persistent homology can be used in loss functions to detect topological features of the NN input image.

* Wikipedia: [Persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology). Gives definition of persistent homology on filtered simplicial complexes $$\emptyset = K_0 \subseteq K_1 \subseteq ... \subseteq K_n = X$$ as images of the simplicial homology maps $$H_p(K_i) \rightarrow H_p(K_j)$$, and gives a list of software packages that compute persistent homology.
