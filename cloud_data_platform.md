    * Databricks is a better platform for Big data(scala, pyspark) Developing.(unbeatable notebook environment)
    * SageMaker is better for Deployment. and if you are not working on big data, SageMaker is a perfect choice working with (Jupyter notebook + Sklearn + Mature containers + Super easy deployment).
    * SageMaker provides "real time inference", very easy to build and deploy, very impressive. you can check the [official SageMaker Github](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/scikit_learn_inference_pipeline).
