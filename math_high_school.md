title: Math (High School Problems)

This is a collection of problems from an old notebook from my high school years. I used to collect problems I liked.

1. Suppose $$f(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + ... + a_0$$ has integral conefficients. If the complex roots of $$f(X)$$ have modulus $$1$$, show that these roots are also roots of the number $$1$$.
