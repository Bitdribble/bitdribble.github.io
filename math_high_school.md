title: Math (High School Problems)
---

This is a collection of problems from an old notebook from my high school years. I used to collect problems I liked.

Notations:
- $$\mathbb{N}$$ is the set of non negative integers
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is the set of integers
- $$\mathbb{Q}$$ is the set of rational numbers
- $$\mathbb{R}$$ is the set of real numbers
- $$\mathbb{C}$$ is the set of complex numbers


1. Suppose $$f(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + ... + a_0$$ has integral conefficients. If the complex roots of $$f(X)$$ have modulus $$1$$, show that these roots are also roots of the number $$1$$.

2. For any $$\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}$$ there exists $$\theta \in (0, \infty)$$ such that $$[\theta^{2^n}] = \alpha \; mod \; \beta$$ for all $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$

3. From any $$2n-1$$ integers, we can find $$n$$ whose sum is divisible by $$n$$.
