title: Math (High School Problems - Hints and Solutions)

This is a collection of problems from an old notebook from my high school years. I used to collect problems I liked.

1. Using Viete relations, if $$z_1, ..., z_n$$ are roots of a polinomial of the form $$X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + ... + a_0$$ with integral coefficients, then so are $$z_1^k, ..., z_n^k$$, for $$k \in \mathbb{N}$$. Furthermode, also by Viete relations, the coefficients $$a_{n-1}, ... a_0$$ have to be uniformly bounded. Each sequence $$z_i, z_i^2, ...$$ must be then periodic, and, therefore, a certain power of $$z_i$$ must equal $$1$$, for each $$i$$.
