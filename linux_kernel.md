#### Books
* [Linux Device Drivers: Where the Kernel Meets the Hardware](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Drivers-Kernel-Hardware-ebook/dp/B0026OR2XQ), A. Rubini et al. I used an earlier edition of this book to learn how to program Linux drivers - Ethernet, i2c, serial, FPGA drivers - back at Brix Networks, circa 2000-2005.
* [Essential Linux Device Drivers](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Linux-Device-Drivers-Development-ebook/dp/B004YEGWNC), by Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran. Very complete, well written.

#### Other
* [Linux kernel cross reference](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source)
