Constantinos Kavafis... Poetul Levantului, mai precis, al Levantului antic, al vechilor greci, văzuți prin ochii sensibili ai unui clasicist pierdut, undeva, în prima jumătate a secolului XX...

*Modern Alexandria is scarcely a city of the soul,* scrie E.M Forster, care l-a întâlnit și chiar descoperit, pentru publicul de limba engleză, pe Kavafis. *Founded upon cotton with the concurrence of onions and eggs, ill built, ill planned, ill drained - many hard things can be said against it, and most are said by its inhabitants. Yet to some of them, as they traverse the streets, a delightful experience can occur. They hear their own name proclaimed in firn1 yet meditative accents-accents that seem not so much to expect an answer as to pay homage to the fact of individuality. They turn and see a Greek gentleman in a straw hat, standing absolutely motionless at a slight angle to the universe. His arms are extended, possibly. "Oh, Cavafy...!"*
