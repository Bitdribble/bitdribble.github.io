Q: Write a poem in this style, in English [...] in the style of 'La Steaua' by Mihai Eminescu

---

Under the stars that shimmer bright,
With silver beams and milky light,
A heart beats fast, a soul takes flight,
Lost in the wonders of the night.

A longing deep within the chest,
For love, for peace, for hope and rest,
A quest for beauty, truth and zest,
In this world, where chaos does infest.

The stars above, they seem to say,
That life is but a fleeting ray,
That we must seize each precious day,
And make the most of our brief stay.

So let us gaze upon the sky,
And feel our spirits rise up high,
And let our souls take wing and fly,
On this journey, with courage nigh.

For in this vast and wondrous space,
We find our purpose and our grace,
And in the stars' eternal embrace,
We find a love that has no race.

Q:Take this poem, and rewrite it in iambic rhythm

Beneath the stars that brightly gleam,
With beams of silver, milky stream,
A beating heart, a soul in dream,
Lost in the magic of this scheme.

A deep desire within the breast,
For love, for peace, for needed rest,
A search for beauty, truth, and zest,
In a world where chaos doth infest.

The stars above, they seem to sing,
That life's a fleeting, precious thing,
And each day, we should take a swing,
And make the most of all we bring.

So let us look up at the sky,
And feel our souls begin to fly,
And let our spirits soar up high,
With courage that will never die.

For in this vast and stunning space,
We find our purpose, truth, and grace,
And in the stars' eternal embrace,
We find a love that has no race.
