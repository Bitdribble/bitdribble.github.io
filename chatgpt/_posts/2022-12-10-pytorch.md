Q: In pytorch, does `build_vocab_from_iterator()` collect the most frequent tokens?

---

Yes, the `build_vocab_from_iterator()` method in PyTorch collects the most frequent tokens in an iterator. This method is typically used to build a vocabulary for a text dataset by iterating over the dataset and counting the frequency of each token. The resulting vocabulary will include the tokens that appear most frequently in the dataset.

Q: For a pytorch tensor, how do I apply a lambda function element by element preserving the tensor type?

---

To apply a lambda function element-by-element to a PyTorch tensor, while preserving the tensor type, you can use the torch.Tensor.apply_ method. This method applies the given function to each element of the tensor, and returns a new tensor with the same shape and type as the original tensor, containing the results of the function applied element-wise.

For example, suppose you have a PyTorch tensor x with the following values:

```python
x = tensor([[1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6]])
```

To apply a lambda function that squares each element of x, you can use the apply_ method like this:

```python
y = x.apply_(lambda x: x**2)
```

In this example, the lambda function `lambda x: x**2` squares each element of x. The `apply_` method applies this function to each element of x, and returns a new tensor y with the same shape and type as x, containing the squared values. The resulting tensor y would have the following values:

```python
y = tensor([[ 1,  4,  9],
            [16, 25, 36]])
```

As you can see, the `apply_` method allows you to apply a lambda function element-by-element to a PyTorch tensor, while preserving the tensor type. This can be useful for performing element-wise operations on tensors without changing their shape or type.

It is also worth noting that the `apply_` method is different from the `torch.Tensor.apply` method. The apply method applies the given function to each element of the tensor, but it returns a tensor of type torch.Tensor, regardless of the type of the original tensor. In contrast, the `apply_` method preserves the type of the original tensor, which can be useful in certain situations.
