Q: Why is the Carnot cycle unachievable in reality?

---

The Carnot cycle is unachievable in reality because it is a theoretical model that assumes that the heat transfer between the system and the heat reservoir occurs at a constant temperature, which is not possible in real-world systems. Additionally, real-world systems also experience friction and other forms of energy loss, which the Carnot cycle does not take into account. Therefore, while the Carnot cycle serves as a useful theoretical model for understanding the maximum possible efficiency of a heat engine, it is not a realistic model of any actual heat engine.

---

Q: Why is the Carnot cycle the most efficient heat engine, compared with other possible heat engines - not necessarily other Carnot cycles?

---

The Carnot cycle is considered to be the most efficient heat engine because it is a reversible process and it operates between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures. The Carnot efficiency, which is the maximum possible efficiency of a heat engine, is given by the formula:

η = 1 - (T_c / T_h)

Where T_c is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_h is the temperature of the hot reservoir. The efficiency of the Carnot cycle is independent of the working substance used in the heat engine and depends only on the temperatures of the heat reservoirs.

It means that, as the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoir increases, the efficiency of the Carnot cycle increases. And since the Carnot cycle is reversible, it means that no energy is lost during the process. This makes it the most efficient among all possible heat engines.

Q: What do we get when we integrate temperature by entropy?

---

When we integrate temperature (T) by entropy (S) we get the change in internal energy (U) of a thermodynamic system. This relationship is given by the thermodynamic identity:

∫dU = TdS - PdV

This identity is known as the first law of thermodynamics and it states that the change in internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. The first term on the right hand side, TdS, represents the change in internal energy due to heat transfer and the second term, -PdV, represents the change in internal energy due to work done by the system.

It's worth noticing that the integral sign is not indicating a definite integration, but it's indicating that the change in internal energy is a path function, which means that depends on the path taken to go from the initial state to the final state.

---

Q: In what way are (temperature, entropy) dual to (volume, pressure)?

---

Temperature and entropy are dual to volume and pressure in the sense that they are related by the thermodynamic equation of state. This equation, known as the ideal gas law, relates the pressure, volume, and temperature of a gas in a manner consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. Specifically, it states that PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. This equation shows that the product of pressure and volume is proportional to the temperature, and thus temperature and entropy are related to the other two variables in a complementary way. In thermodynamic systems, pressure and volume are conjugate variables, as are temperature and entropy.

---

Q: Why are temperature and entropy conjugate variables?

---

Temperature and entropy are considered conjugate variables because they are related by the second law of thermodynamics. The second law states that the entropy of a closed thermodynamic system will always increase over time, and that a state of maximum entropy is thermodynamically stable. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a system, and entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of those particles.

When a system is in thermal equilibrium, it means that the temperature is the same throughout the system. In this state, the entropy is also at a maximum. The second law states that the entropy of a closed system will always increase over time, which means that entropy and temperature are conjugate variables, because the temperature of the system is constantly increasing until it reaches thermal equilibrium and the entropy reaches its maximum.

Additionally, in thermodynamic systems, the change in entropy is directly proportional to the heat added or removed from a system, and inversely proportional to the temperature at which that heat is added or removed. This relationship is also an indication of how temperature and entropy are conjugate variables.

---

Q: Is entropy an extensive thermodynamic variable? How is that proved?

---

Entropy is an extensive thermodynamic variable. This means that the total entropy of a system is directly proportional to the amount of substance present in the system. This can be proved mathematically by considering the definition of entropy: S = k * ln(Ω) where S is entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and Ω is the number of microstates of the system. Since Ω is directly proportional to the number of particles in the system, and ln(Ω) is a monotonically increasing function, it follows that S is directly proportional to the number of particles in the system, making it an extensive variable. [The proof is wrong, but the result is correct. 

---

Q: Why is the number of microstates proportional to the number of particles in a system?

---

The number of microstates of a system is proportional to the number of particles in the system [not true!] because each particle in the system can occupy a certain number of energy states, and the total number of microstates is equal to the product of the number of energy states that each particle can occupy.

In a thermodynamic system, each particle can be in one of the many energy states, and the number of states available to a particle is determined by the energy levels of the particle, which can be quantized. The microstates of a system are the different ways in which the energy levels of the particles can be occupied by the particles. For example, if there are N particles in a system, and each particle has M energy levels, then there are M^N possible microstates of the system. As we can see, the number of microstates is directly proportional to the number of particles.

In addition, the number of microstates for a given number of particles in a system also depends on the symmetry of the system. In a system with high symmetry, there are fewer microstates for a given number of particles than in a system with low symmetry.

In summary, the number of microstates is proportional to the number of particles in a system because the number of microstates is equal to the product of the number of energy states that each particle can occupy and the number of particles in the system, and it also depends on the symmetry of the system.

---

Q: Isn't it true, instead, that the logarithm of the number of microstates is proportional to the number of particles - and not the number of microstates itself?

---

Yes, you are correct. I apologize for the confusion. The logarithm of the number of microstates, also known as the configurational entropy, is proportional to the number of particles in a system, rather than the number of microstates itself.

As I mentioned earlier, the number of microstates of a system is equal to the product of the number of energy states that each particle can occupy, and the number of particles in the system. Since the number of microstates can be very large, it is more convenient to use the logarithm of the number of microstates, which is directly proportional to the number of particles. This is because the logarithm function is a monotonically increasing function and it is useful to simplify the calculations.

In summary, the configurational entropy, which is the logarithm of the number of microstates, is proportional to the number of particles in a system. The thermodynamic entropy, which is defined as S = k * ln(Ω) where S is entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and Ω is the number of microstates of the system, is also extensive and directly proportional to the number of particles in the system.

Q: Does entropy remain constant during adiabatic transitions?

---

Entropy remains constant during adiabatic transitions if the system is thermally insulated and no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. An adiabatic process is a process in which no heat is added or removed from the system, and thus the internal energy of the system can only change due to work done on or by the system.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system will not decrease over time. In an adiabatic process, the change in internal energy is equal to the work done by the system, and as long as no heat is exchanged, the entropy of the system will remain constant.

If the process is not adiabatic, and heat is exchanged, then the entropy can change. For example, in an isothermal process, where the temperature is constant, the internal energy can change due to the exchange of heat, and the entropy will change accordingly.

It's worth noting that in real systems it's hard to achieve an adiabatic process, as some heat is always exchanged with the surroundings, but the process can be considered adiabatic if the heat exchanged is negligible compared to the internal energy of the system.

Q: How do we see in the Carnot cycle that the entropy is constant during adiabatic transitions, without using the first law of thermodynamics?

---

The Carnot cycle is a theoretical heat engine cycle that is reversible and operates between two heat reservoirs, at temperatures T_H and T_C. It consists of four processes: two isothermal expansions (at T_H and T_C) and two adiabatic expansions.

The entropy is constant during adiabatic transitions in the Carnot cycle can be demonstrated without using the first law of thermodynamics by using the concept of reversibility. A reversible process is one that can be reversed without leaving any trace on the system or the surroundings. In the Carnot cycle, the two adiabatic expansions are reversible and therefore, the entropy does not change during these processes.

The entropy of the system during the isothermal expansions can change due to the exchange of heat with the reservoir, but the total entropy change of the system and the reservoir will be zero, since the process is reversible.

For example, during the isothermal expansion at T_H, the system will absorb heat from the hot reservoir, increasing its internal energy and entropy, but at the same time, the hot reservoir will lose an equivalent amount of heat and decrease its entropy. The entropy change of the system and the reservoir will be zero, since the process is reversible. The same reasoning applies to the isothermal expansion at T_C.

Therefore, by using the concept of reversibility, we can demonstrate that the entropy is constant during adiabatic transitions in the Carnot cycle, without using the first law of thermodynamics.

Q: Can the first law of thermodynamics be proved?

---

The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant. It states that the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. Mathematically, it can be written as ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.

The first law of thermodynamics can be experimentally verified and tested, but it can not be proven in the traditional sense. This is because the first law is a statement of the conservation of energy which is a fundamental principle in physics, that has been established and supported by a wide range of experiments, measurements and observations throughout the history of physics.

However, it is important to note that the first law is a macroscopic statement, and it is based on the assumption that energy is conserved at the microscopic level, which is something that can be proven by using the laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity.

Also, the first law of thermodynamics is a consequence of the more fundamental laws of physics, such as the laws of mechanics and the conservation of mass-energy. These laws are well-established and have been thoroughly tested and verified in many experiments and observations.

In summary, the first law of thermodynamics can not be proven in the traditional sense, but it can be experimentally verified and is supported by a wide range of experiments, measurements and observations, and it is a consequence of the more fundamental laws of physics.

Q: How is entropy defined classically, using the Carnot cycle?

---

Entropy is a thermodynamic property that is related to the disorder or randomness of a system. In a classical thermodynamics context, entropy can be defined using the Carnot cycle, which is a theoretical heat engine cycle that is reversible and operates between two heat reservoirs, at temperatures T_H and T_C.

The entropy of a system can be defined as the amount of heat absorbed or rejected by the system during an isothermal process, divided by the temperature of the heat reservoir.

In the Carnot cycle, the isothermal expansions occur at temperatures T_H and T_C, and the entropy change of the system during these processes can be calculated as:
ΔS = Q/T

Where Q is the heat absorbed or rejected by the system and T is the temperature of the heat reservoir.

It's important to note that entropy change during adiabatic processes is zero, as these processes are reversible and no heat is exchanged with the surroundings.

The entropy change of the system during a complete Carnot cycle is the sum of the entropy changes during the two isothermal expansions. The total entropy change of the system and the surroundings is zero, since the process is reversible.

Carnot cycle is a theoretical cycle that is reversible and operates between two heat reservoirs, so it is not possible to achieve it in practice, but it serves as a theoretical model to understand the fundamental principles of thermodynamics.

---

Q: How can you prove that entropy, by this definition, is same as the probabilistic definition?

---

The probabilistic definition of entropy is based on the concept of microstates and the number of ways in which the energy of a system can be distributed among its particles. It is defined as:
S = k * ln(Ω)

Where S is entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and Ω is the number of microstates of the system.

It is possible to show that this probabilistic definition of entropy is equivalent to the classical definition of entropy using the Carnot cycle.

One way to prove this is by using the concept of reversibility. A reversible process is one that can be reversed without leaving any trace on the system or the surroundings. In the Carnot cycle, the two adiabatic expansions are reversible and the entropy does not change during these processes. The isothermal expansions are also reversible, and the entropy change of the system can be calculated as:
ΔS = Q/T

Where Q is the heat absorbed or rejected by the system and T is the temperature of the heat reservoir.

The number of microstates of the system can also be related to the heat absorbed or rejected by the system. It can be shown that the heat absorbed by the system during an isothermal process is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates of the system that are accessible to the system at that temperature.

Therefore, by combining the probabilistic definition of entropy with the classical definition of entropy, it can be shown that the two definitions are equivalent and that the probabilistic definition of entropy is a statistical interpretation of the classical definition of entropy.

It's worth noting that the proof you mentioned is not an easy task, it requires a deep knowledge of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and it's a topic of ongoing research.
