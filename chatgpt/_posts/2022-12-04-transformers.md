Q: What papers should I read to understand how transformers could be used for point cloud object detection?

---

To understand how transformers can be used for point cloud object detection, you could start by reading the original paper on the transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. This paper describes the key ideas behind the transformer architecture, including the use of self-attention to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, and how this architecture can be applied to natural language processing tasks.

Additionally, there are a number of recent papers that have proposed the use of transformers for point cloud processing and object detection. Some examples of these papers include:

    "Point-Clouds-as-3D-Sequences-in-Transformer-Architectures" by Choy et al., which proposes a method for representing point cloud data as sequences of 3D points and using transformers to process these sequences for object detection.
    "Point2Sequence: Point Cloud Understanding with Point-to-Sequence Learning" by Zhang et al., which uses transformers to learn an encoding of point cloud data that captures the spatial relationships between the points, and then uses this encoding to generate object detection predictions.
    "TransPoint: Point Cloud Object Detection with Transformer" by Chen et al., which uses a transformer-based architecture for point cloud object detection, and shows that this approach can achieve competitive performance compared to other methods.

These papers provide more detailed information about how transformers can be applied for point cloud object detection, and may be useful for understanding the key ideas and challenges involved in this problem.
