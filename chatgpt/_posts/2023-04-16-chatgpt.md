Q: What did St Augustine do before he became a Christian?

---

Before his conversion to Christianity, St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD) lived a life that was characterized by hedonism and intellectual curiosity. He was born in North Africa in what is now modern-day Algeria and was raised by his mother, St. Monica, who was a devout Christian.

Augustine was an excellent student, and he received a classical education in rhetoric, literature, and philosophy. He was particularly interested in the philosophy of the ancient Greeks, and he studied the works of Plato and the Stoics.

After finishing his formal education, Augustine became a teacher of rhetoric and moved to Rome. He later moved to Milan, where he became a professor of rhetoric. It was in Milan that he met St. Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, who had a profound influence on Augustine's spiritual journey.

Despite his intellectual pursuits, Augustine lived a life of debauchery and promiscuity. He had a mistress and fathered a son out of wedlock. However, his mother's prayers and the influence of St. Ambrose eventually led him to convert to Christianity in 386 AD.

---

Q: Were poor people tending to become Christian in his time, or rich people?

---

During St. Augustine's time, Christianity was gaining popularity among people of all social classes. While there were certainly wealthy individuals who converted to Christianity, it is worth noting that many of the early Christians were from humble backgrounds.

In the Roman Empire, Christianity initially spread among the lower classes, including slaves and the urban poor. These groups were attracted to the message of equality and compassion that was central to Christian teaching. Many of these early Christians found solace in the promise of an afterlife where their suffering would be redeemed, a concept that was particularly appealing to those who faced poverty, persecution, or oppression in this life.

However, as Christianity grew and gained more acceptance in Roman society, it also began to attract wealthier converts. Some members of the aristocracy were drawn to the faith's moral teachings, while others may have seen Christianity as a way to gain social status or political power.

Overall, while Christianity was initially more popular among the poor, it eventually became a faith that was embraced by people from all walks of life. St. Augustine himself was from a wealthy family and had a prominent position in Roman society before his conversion to Christianity.

Q: What were other religions in St Augustine's time? How did they compare to Christianity?

---

In St. Augustine's time (354â€“430 AD), there were several other religions and philosophical movements present in the Mediterranean world, including:

    Paganism: The indigenous religions of Rome, Greece, and other Mediterranean cultures that worshiped a variety of gods and goddesses.

    Judaism: A monotheistic religion that emerged in the Middle East and was centered on the worship of Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

    Manichaeism: A Gnostic religion that originated in Persia and was founded by the prophet Mani. Manichaeism taught that the world was divided between good and evil, and that human beings could attain salvation by freeing their spirits from the physical world.

    Neoplatonism: A philosophical movement that drew on the teachings of Plato and emphasized the existence of a higher reality beyond the physical world.

    Mithraism: A mystery religion that originated in Persia and spread throughout the Roman Empire. Mithraism was centered on the worship of the god Mithras, who was believed to be a mediator between humans and the divine.

Christianity, in comparison, was a relatively new religion that had emerged in the eastern Mediterranean and was spreading throughout the Roman Empire during Augustine's lifetime. Christianity was distinct from these other religions in that it was monotheistic and centered on the worship of Jesus Christ as the son of God and savior of humanity. It also had a strong emphasis on morality, charity, and personal conversion, which set it apart from the more ritualistic and philosophical religions of the time. However, Christianity faced significant opposition and persecution from both the Roman state and other religious groups, particularly pagan and Jewish communities.

---

Q: Why was Augustine attracted to Christianity and not, say, Manichaeism?

---

Augustine was initially attracted to Manichaeism because of its emphasis on the struggle between good and evil, which resonated with his own personal struggles with temptation and sin. However, he eventually rejected Manichaeism because he found its teachings to be incomplete and unsatisfactory.

Augustine found that Manichaeism did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the existence of evil in the world, and its dualistic worldview was overly simplistic. He also found that its teachings on the nature of the physical world were in conflict with his observations and experiences.

Augustine was later drawn to Christianity because it offered a more complete and coherent worldview. Christianity provided answers to the questions that had troubled him for years, such as the nature of God, the problem of evil, and the meaning of human existence. Additionally, Augustine was deeply influenced by the writings of the Christian theologian Ambrose, who helped him to see the beauty and coherence of Christian doctrine. Augustine's personal experiences of conversion also played a significant role in his attraction to Christianity. Ultimately, he found in Christianity the truth and meaning that he had been seeking for so long.

---

Q: What did he discover was the nature of God?

---

Augustine's understanding of the nature of God is rooted in his belief that God is the supreme, perfect, and immutable being who created the world out of nothing. Augustine believed that God is infinite, eternal, and indivisible, existing outside of time and space.

Augustine also believed that God is a Trinity of persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. He taught that these three persons are distinct but inseparable, sharing the same divine essence or nature. This doctrine of the Trinity was a central feature of Augustine's theology and has become a defining characteristic of Christian belief.

In addition to these metaphysical concepts, Augustine believed that God is a personal and loving being who is intimately involved in the lives of human beings. He taught that God is the source of all goodness, and that all of creation is ultimately oriented towards the worship and enjoyment of God. Augustine believed that by knowing and loving God, human beings can find true happiness and fulfillment.

---

Q: Did the doctrine of the Trinity originate with Augustine?

---

No, the doctrine of the Trinity did not originate with Augustine, but rather developed over several centuries of Christian thought and reflection. The doctrine of the Trinity is rooted in the New Testament and is a central tenet of Christian theology.

The earliest formulations of the doctrine of the Trinity can be found in the writings of the early church fathers, such as Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Origen, who articulated the belief in one God who exists as three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. However, it was not until the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD that the doctrine of the Trinity was formally defined and established as a central tenet of Christian belief.

Augustine's contribution to the doctrine of the Trinity was primarily in his defense and explication of the doctrine, particularly in his works "De Trinitate" and "On the Trinity". Augustine helped to clarify and articulate the doctrine of the Trinity, emphasizing the unity and diversity of the three persons of the Trinity and their inseparable relationship. His writings on the Trinity have been highly influential in Christian theology and continue to shape Christian thinking on this central doctrine.

Q: What was Augustine's view of slavery?

---

Augustine's view of slavery was complex, and his writings on the subject reflect both the social norms and values of his time as well as his Christian beliefs.

On the one hand, Augustine accepted the institution of slavery as a fact of life in the Roman Empire and did not directly challenge the legality of slavery. He believed that slaves were necessary for the functioning of society and that it was appropriate for masters to own and use them.

However, Augustine also believed that slaves were human beings and therefore had moral value and dignity. He argued that Christian masters had a responsibility to treat their slaves with kindness and respect, and to provide for their physical and spiritual needs. He also advocated for the liberation of slaves who had been unjustly enslaved, and for the humane treatment of slaves in general.

Moreover, Augustine believed that all human beings were equal in the eyes of God and that slavery was a consequence of sin and human fallenness. He taught that the ultimate goal of humanity was to live in peace and harmony with one another, and that slavery was incompatible with this ideal.

In summary, while Augustine did not directly challenge the legality of slavery, he believed that slaves were human beings who deserved to be treated with dignity and respect. He believed that the ultimate goal of society was the peaceful coexistence of all human beings, and that slavery was a result of human sinfulness and the fallenness of the world.

---

Q: What did Augustine think about foreign peoples, for example, barbarians?

---

Augustine's views on foreign peoples, including barbarians, were influenced by his Christian beliefs and his understanding of the nature of humanity.

Augustine believed that all human beings were created in the image of God and therefore possessed inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their nationality or cultural background. He rejected the notion that any one group of people was inherently superior or inferior to another, and argued that all people were capable of attaining salvation through faith in Christ.

At the same time, Augustine recognized the cultural and linguistic differences that existed between different groups of people, including the barbarians. He believed that these differences were the result of God's providential plan and that they should be respected and appreciated rather than dismissed or ignored.

Augustine also recognized the potential for conflict and misunderstanding between different groups of people, and he advocated for the peaceful coexistence of all nations and peoples. He believed that Christians had a responsibility to promote peace and justice in the world, and to work towards reconciliation between different groups of people.

In his writings, Augustine expressed sympathy and compassion for those who were marginalized or oppressed, including foreigners and slaves. He saw it as a Christian duty to care for the vulnerable and to work towards greater equality and justice for all people, regardless of their background or status.

---

Q: How did Augustine view Plato, and platonism?

---

Augustine was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Plato, and his writings reflect a strong engagement with Platonic thought. Augustine saw in Plato's philosophy a profound insight into the nature of reality and the human condition, and he drew heavily on Platonic ideas in his own philosophical and theological works.

At the same time, Augustine also recognized the limitations of Platonism and was critical of certain aspects of Plato's thought. For example, Augustine rejected Plato's belief in the pre-existence of the soul, and he argued that the soul was created by God at the moment of conception.

In addition, Augustine was critical of certain aspects of the Platonic emphasis on reason and contemplation, arguing that the human will and the pursuit of virtue were equally important for the attainment of salvation. Augustine also emphasized the importance of divine grace in the spiritual life, and he saw this as a crucial element of Christian faith that was not fully developed in Platonic philosophy.

Overall, Augustine viewed Plato and Platonism as important sources of philosophical and theological insight, but he also recognized the limitations of this tradition and sought to integrate Platonic ideas with his own Christian beliefs in a way that was faithful to the teachings of the Bible and the Christian tradition.

---

Q: Did Augustine think that the individual is more important than the tribe, or than society?

---

Augustine's views on the relationship between the individual and society were complex, and his writings reflect a tension between the importance of individual autonomy and the need for social cohesion and order.

On the one hand, Augustine emphasized the inherent dignity and value of the individual, arguing that each person was created in the image of God and therefore possessed inherent worth and significance. He believed that individuals had the freedom to choose their own actions and were responsible for their own moral choices.

At the same time, Augustine also recognized the importance of social structures and institutions for maintaining order and promoting the common good. He saw society as a necessary framework for human flourishing and argued that individuals had a responsibility to contribute to the well-being of the broader community.

In Augustine's view, the relationship between the individual and society was ultimately mediated by the divine, and he saw the Christian faith as providing a framework for the integration of individual autonomy and social order. He emphasized the importance of love, charity, and justice in both individual and social life, and he believed that the pursuit of these virtues could help to reconcile the tensions between the individual and the community.

Overall, while Augustine recognized the importance of individual autonomy and the inherent value of each person, he also emphasized the importance of social structures and institutions for promoting the common good and maintaining social order. He saw the Christian faith as providing a framework for the integration of individual autonomy and social responsibility, and he emphasized the importance of love, charity, and justice in both individual and social life.

---

Q: Did Augustine sermon in Church? Was he a priest, leading the regular church service?

---

Yes, Augustine was a priest and bishop in the early Christian Church, and he regularly preached sermons to his congregation. During his time as bishop of Hippo, Augustine was responsible for overseeing the administration of the sacraments and leading the regular church services, including the celebration of the Eucharist.

Augustine saw preaching as an important part of his pastoral duties, and he devoted a significant amount of time and energy to preparing and delivering sermons to his congregation. His sermons covered a wide range of topics, including theology, ethics, and the practical challenges of Christian life.

Many of Augustine's sermons have been preserved and continue to be studied today, providing insight into his theological and pastoral concerns and his approach to preaching and teaching in the early Christian Church.

---

Q: When he led burial ceremonies, did he adapt the service to the qualities of the individual being laid to rest - or was the service standardized and similar from one burial to another?

---

While there were certain elements of the burial service that were standardized in Augustine's time, such as the recitation of prayers and the reading of Scripture, he also recognized the unique qualities and circumstances of each individual being laid to rest.

Augustine believed that each person was created in the image of God and possessed inherent worth and dignity, and he emphasized the importance of honoring the individual in the burial service. He believed that the service should be tailored to the needs and circumstances of the deceased and their family, and he encouraged mourners to express their grief and honor the memory of the departed in a way that was meaningful to them.

At the same time, Augustine also emphasized the importance of the burial service as a communal act, and he believed that the service should bring together the entire Christian community in prayer and remembrance. He saw the burial service as an opportunity for the community to express their solidarity and support for the family of the deceased and to offer prayers for the repose of their soul.

Overall, while there were certain elements of the burial service that were standardized, Augustine recognized the importance of adapting the service to the unique qualities and circumstances of the individual being laid to rest and of providing comfort and support to their family and community.

---

Q: Are there known Augustine sermons from burial services? Could you provide some references?

---

Yes, there are several sermons by Augustine that were delivered at burial services. Here are a few examples:

- Sermon 23: On the Burial of the Dead - In this sermon, delivered in the early 5th century, Augustine reflects on the Christian attitude towards death and the importance of honoring the dead through burial.

- Sermon 299: On the Burial of Patricius - This sermon, delivered in the late 4th century, was delivered at the funeral of Augustine's mother, Monica. Augustine reflects on the life of Monica and the importance of the Christian hope in the face of death.

- Sermon 363: On the Burial of Satyrus - This sermon, delivered in the late 4th century, was delivered at the funeral of Satyrus, the brother of Augustine's friend and fellow bishop, Ambrose. Augustine reflects on the life and character of Satyrus and the Christian hope of resurrection.

These sermons, along with many others, can be found in various editions of Augustine's collected works, such as the "Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers" series, which includes a translation of Augustine's writings into English.

---

Q: What languages did Augustine speak?

---

Augustine was born and raised in Roman North Africa, which was a multicultural and multilingual region. As a result, he was exposed to a variety of languages and cultures during his upbringing.

Augustine is known to have been fluent in Latin, which was the language of education, administration, and the Church in the Roman Empire. Latin was the language in which Augustine wrote all of his major works, including his theological treatises and his sermons.

In addition to Latin, Augustine was also familiar with Greek, which was the language of the Eastern Mediterranean and the language of the New Testament. Augustine studied Greek as part of his education and was proficient enough in the language to translate Greek texts into Latin.

It is possible that Augustine was also familiar with Punic, the language spoken by the indigenous Berber population of North Africa. However, there is no direct evidence of this, and it is not clear to what extent Punic was still spoken in Augustine's time.

Overall, Augustine was at least bilingual, with a strong command of Latin and a good knowledge of Greek, reflecting the cultural and linguistic diversity of his North African upbringing.

---

Q: Did Augustine have any religious fights or debates with opponents?

---

Yes, Augustine was involved in a number of religious debates and controversies throughout his career, both as a defender of Christian orthodoxy and as a critic of various heresies and false teachings.

One of the most famous controversies in which Augustine was involved was the Donatist Controversy, which centered on the question of whether sacraments administered by "unworthy" clergy were valid. Augustine argued that the validity of the sacraments did not depend on the moral character of the priest, but rather on the authority of the Church and the power of the sacraments themselves. This controversy lasted for several decades and was a major focus of Augustine's writing and preaching during his time as Bishop of Hippo.

Another controversy in which Augustine was involved was the Pelagian Controversy, which centered on the question of human nature and the role of grace in salvation. Pelagius, a British monk, argued that human beings had the ability to live a sinless life and that salvation could be achieved through human effort alone. Augustine argued that human nature was fallen and corrupt, and that salvation could only be achieved through the grace of God. This controversy lasted for several years and resulted in a number of written exchanges between Augustine and Pelagius.

Augustine was also involved in debates with various other groups and individuals, including Manichaeans, Arians, and Jews. These debates were often centered on questions of theology and the interpretation of Scripture, and Augustine was known for his skill as a debater and his ability to defend orthodox Christian beliefs against heretical challenges.

Overall, Augustine was a highly influential figure in the early Christian Church, and his writings and teachings continue to be studied and debated today.

---

Q: Who were his interlocutors in the Donatist controversy - and what were their arguments?

---

The Donatist Controversy, which lasted from the fourth to the sixth century, was a long-standing dispute between the Donatist Church and the Catholic Church in North Africa. The Donatists were a group of Christians who believed that the Catholic Church had become corrupt and that the sacraments administered by Catholic clergy were therefore invalid. Augustine, as Bishop of Hippo, was a leading opponent of the Donatists and played a key role in the Catholic Church's response to their claims.

The Donatist Church had several key figures who served as Augustine's interlocutors in the controversy. Among these were Donatus, the founder of the Donatist movement, and Primianus, one of their most prominent bishops. The Donatists argued that the Catholic Church had become compromised by its association with the Roman state and that its clergy had become tainted by association with those who had denied their faith during times of persecution.

The Donatists also argued that the validity of the sacraments depended on the moral character of the priest who administered them. They believed that a priest who had lapsed during times of persecution or who had been associated with those who had lapsed could not validly administer the sacraments, even if they were ordained by a bishop who had not lapsed. This belief was known as "donatism," and it was a central tenet of the Donatist Church.

Augustine, in response, argued that the validity of the sacraments did not depend on the moral character of the priest who administered them, but rather on the power of the sacraments themselves and the authority of the Church that administered them. Augustine also argued that the Catholic Church was the true Church founded by Christ and that the Donatist Church was a schismatic group that had separated itself from the Church and its authority.

The Donatist Controversy was a complex and long-standing dispute, and the arguments and counterarguments put forward by both sides were many and varied. However, at its heart, the controversy was a theological and ecclesiological debate about the nature of the Church, the validity of the sacraments, and the role of grace in salvation.

---

Q: Was there also a political angle to Augustine's position in the Donatist controversy?

---

Yes, there was a political angle to Augustine's position in the Donatist controversy. The controversy was not just a theological dispute, but also had political and social dimensions that were intertwined with the religious issues at stake.

At the heart of the controversy was the question of who had the authority to govern the Church in North Africa. The Donatists argued that they were the true heirs of the African Church, and that they had the right to govern themselves independently of the Catholic Church. They also argued that the Roman state had no authority to interfere in Church affairs and that the Catholic Church had become corrupted by its association with the state.

Augustine, on the other hand, believed that the Catholic Church was the true Church founded by Christ, and that it had the authority to govern the Church in North Africa. He also believed that the Church and the state were mutually supportive institutions, and that the state had a legitimate role to play in protecting the Church and ensuring the welfare of its members.

Augustine's position was therefore not just a theological one, but also a political one. He believed that the unity of the Church was essential to its effectiveness and that the Donatist schism was a threat to that unity. He also believed that the state had a responsibility to support the Church and to protect it from internal divisions and external threats.

The Donatist Controversy therefore had significant political implications, and the debates between the Donatists and the Catholic Church were often heated and passionate. Ultimately, however, Augustine's position prevailed, and the Catholic Church emerged as the dominant religious institution in North Africa.
