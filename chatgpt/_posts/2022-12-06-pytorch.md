Q: In pytorch, should the `Dataset` or `DataLoader` class do the dataset transform?

---

In PyTorch, the `Dataset` class is responsible for representing a dataset and providing access to individual elements of the dataset, while the `DataLoader` class is responsible for managing the loading and batching of the data.

You can apply transformations to the data in a PyTorch `Dataset` using the `__getitem__` method, which should return a transformed version of a sample from the dataset. The `DataLoader` class can then be used to load the data from the `Dataset` in batches, possibly shuffling the data and applying other options.

Here's an example:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        # Transform the data here
        return transformed_data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

dataset = MyDataset(data)

# Create a DataLoader to load the data in batches
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Loop through the data in batches
for data in data_loader:
    # Use the data here
    pass
```

In this example, the `__getitem__` method of the `MyDataset` class is where the data transformation is applied. The `DataLoader` then loads the data from the `MyDataset` in batches.

Q: In the code below, what is the return type of ImageFolder?

```python
from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder

train_dataset = ImageFolder(
    root="mnist-pngs/train",
    transform=data_transforms["train"]
)
  
test_dataset = ImageFolder(
    root="mnist-pngs/test",
    transform=data_transforms["test"]
)
```
---

The `ImageFolder` class in PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets` module is a subclass of the `Dataset` class. This means that an `ImageFolder` object is a dataset object that represents a folder of images, and provides methods for accessing individual images in the dataset.

In the code you provided, `train_dataset` and `test_dataset` are both `ImageFolder` objects that represent the training and test datasets, respectively. The `ImageFolder` class takes two arguments: `root`, which specifies the path to the root directory of the dataset, and `transform`, which specifies the transformations to apply to the data.

The return type of the `ImageFolder` class is `ImageFolder`, so in this case the return type of `train_dataset` and `test_dataset` would both be `ImageFolder`.

Q: How do I get the size of a `Dataset` class instance?

---

To get the size of a `Dataset` class instance in PyTorch, you can use the `__len__` method, which should return the number of samples in the dataset.

Here's an example:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.data[index]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

# Create a dataset
dataset = MyDataset(data)

# Get the size of the dataset
dataset_size = len(dataset)
```

In this example, the `__len__` method of the `MyDataset` class returns the length of the data attribute, which is the number of samples in the dataset. This value is then assigned to the `dataset_size` variable.

Keep in mind that the `__len__` method is not required for a `Dataset` class to be valid, but it is commonly implemented to allow for the size of the dataset to be accessed. If the `__len__` method is not implemented for a `Dataset` class, calling `len(dataset)` will raise a `TypeError`.
