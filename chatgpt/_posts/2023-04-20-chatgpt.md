Q: Who wrote Robin Hood?

---

The character of Robin Hood has been the subject of many literary works, so it depends on which specific work you are referring to.

The legendary figure of Robin Hood is said to have originated in medieval English folklore, and various ballads and stories about him were passed down orally before being written down. Some of the earliest known ballads featuring Robin Hood were collected in the 15th and 16th centuries, but the authors are unknown.

In terms of more recent literary works, there have been many authors who have written stories, novels, and adaptations about Robin Hood. Some notable examples include Howard Pyle's "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" (1883), Roger Lancelyn Green's "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1956), and Robin McKinley's "The Outlaws of Sherwood" (1988).

Q: Did Robin Hood appear in Ivanhoe?

---

Yes, Robin Hood appears in the novel "Ivanhoe" by Sir Walter Scott. In the novel, Robin Hood and his band of outlaws play a key role in helping the hero of the story, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, to escape from captivity. The novel is set in medieval England and features a number of legendary and historical figures, including Richard the Lionheart, King John, and the Templar knights. Robin Hood's appearance in "Ivanhoe" helped to popularize the character even further and solidify his place in English folklore.

Q: Was Robin Hood a saxon?

---

In the earliest legends and ballads about Robin Hood, his ethnicity or social status is not specified. However, in some later works, he is described as being a Saxon.

During the medieval period, England was divided into different social classes and ethnic groups, including the Anglo-Saxons (who were descended from the Germanic tribes that settled in England after the collapse of the Roman Empire) and the Normans (who were descended from the Vikings and had conquered England in 1066). The legend of Robin Hood emerged during a time when there was tension between these two groups, and so it is possible that the character of Robin Hood was originally seen as a symbol of resistance against the Norman conquerors.

However, it's worth noting that the historical accuracy of Robin Hood's ethnicity is difficult to determine, as the character has evolved over time and has been interpreted in different ways by various writers and storytellers.

Q: How did John Little appear in the story?

---

John Little, also known as Little John, is one of the most famous members of Robin Hood's band of outlaws. According to the legend, he was a tall and powerful man who became Robin Hood's loyal companion and second-in-command.

There are different versions of how John Little became a part of Robin Hood's group, but the most common story is that he first met Robin Hood when they had a fight on a narrow bridge over a river. In some versions of the story, Robin Hood was disguised as a friar and John Little refused to let him pass. They fought with staffs, and in the end, Robin Hood was impressed by John Little's strength and offered him a place in his band.

After joining Robin Hood's group, John Little proved himself to be a fierce fighter and a loyal friend to Robin Hood. He was often depicted as the muscle of the group, using his strength to protect his fellow outlaws and to fight against the corrupt authorities who oppressed the people of England.

Q: Was there a love interest in the story?

---

Yes, there are several love interests in the legend of Robin Hood, depending on which version of the story you are referring to.

One of the most famous love interests in the Robin Hood legend is Maid Marian, who is often depicted as a beautiful and courageous noblewoman who becomes Robin Hood's love interest. In some versions of the story, Maid Marian is a member of the nobility who sympathizes with Robin Hood's cause and joins his band of outlaws. In other versions, she is a skilled archer and fighter in her own right, and she often aids Robin Hood in his adventures.

Other love interests in the Robin Hood legend include Allan-a-Dale's sweetheart Ellen, who is rescued by Robin Hood in some versions of the story, and Will Scarlett's wife Midge, who is also sometimes depicted as a member of Robin Hood's band of outlaws.

It's worth noting that the specifics of the romantic relationships in the Robin Hood legend vary depending on the version of the story and the cultural context in which it was written. However, the theme of love and romance is often present in the legend, alongside the themes of adventure, justice, and rebellion.

Q: What other groups were there aside from Normans and Saxons?

---

In addition to the Anglo-Saxons and Normans, there were several other ethnic and cultural groups in medieval England. Some of these groups include:

* Vikings: The Vikings were a seafaring people who originated from Scandinavia and raided and settled in England during the early medieval period.

* Celts: The Celts were a group of people who lived in Britain before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. They had their own distinct language, culture, and traditions, and some Celtic people continued to live in England even after the Anglo-Saxon and Norman conquests.

* Jews: Jews had been living in England since the Roman period, but their presence became more prominent during the medieval period. They faced discrimination and persecution throughout much of English history, including during the time of Robin Hood.

* Outlaw groups: In addition to Robin Hood's band of outlaws, there were other groups of outlaws who lived in the forests and mountains of medieval England. These groups often included escaped serfs, criminals, and other marginalized people who lived outside the law.

It's important to note that the distinctions between these groups were often fluid and complex, and people often identified with multiple ethnic or cultural groups depending on their family background, geographical location, and social status.
