Q: Who wrote Robin Hood?

---

The character of Robin Hood has been the subject of many literary works, so it depends on which specific work you are referring to.

The legendary figure of Robin Hood is said to have originated in medieval English folklore, and various ballads and stories about him were passed down orally before being written down. Some of the earliest known ballads featuring Robin Hood were collected in the 15th and 16th centuries, but the authors are unknown.

In terms of more recent literary works, there have been many authors who have written stories, novels, and adaptations about Robin Hood. Some notable examples include Howard Pyle's "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" (1883), Roger Lancelyn Green's "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1956), and Robin McKinley's "The Outlaws of Sherwood" (1988).

Q: Did Robin Hood appear in Ivanhoe?

---

Yes, Robin Hood appears in the novel "Ivanhoe" by Sir Walter Scott. In the novel, Robin Hood and his band of outlaws play a key role in helping the hero of the story, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, to escape from captivity. The novel is set in medieval England and features a number of legendary and historical figures, including Richard the Lionheart, King John, and the Templar knights. Robin Hood's appearance in "Ivanhoe" helped to popularize the character even further and solidify his place in English folklore.

Q: Was Robin Hood a saxon?

---

In the earliest legends and ballads about Robin Hood, his ethnicity or social status is not specified. However, in some later works, he is described as being a Saxon.

During the medieval period, England was divided into different social classes and ethnic groups, including the Anglo-Saxons (who were descended from the Germanic tribes that settled in England after the collapse of the Roman Empire) and the Normans (who were descended from the Vikings and had conquered England in 1066). The legend of Robin Hood emerged during a time when there was tension between these two groups, and so it is possible that the character of Robin Hood was originally seen as a symbol of resistance against the Norman conquerors.

However, it's worth noting that the historical accuracy of Robin Hood's ethnicity is difficult to determine, as the character has evolved over time and has been interpreted in different ways by various writers and storytellers.
