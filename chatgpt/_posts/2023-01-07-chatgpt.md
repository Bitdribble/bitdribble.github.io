Q: What are some good introductory references about the Ising Model?

---

The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. It is used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanical systems. Here are a few references that you might find helpful as an introduction to the Ising model:

* "Lectures on the Ising Model" by David A. Lavis and George M. Bell: This is a set of lecture notes that provide a detailed introduction to the Ising model.

* "The Ising Model" by David C. Mattis: This is a book that provides a comprehensive introduction to the Ising model.

* "The Ising Model" by James Binney, David Skinner, and Barbara E. Watson: This is a chapter in the book "The Theory of Critical Phenomena" that provides an introduction to the Ising model.

* "The Ising Model" by Daniel V. Schroeder: This is a chapter in the book "An Introduction to Thermal Physics" that provides an introduction to the Ising model.

I hope these references are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Q: In statistical mechanics microstates, what are extensive quantities?

---

In statistical mechanics, an extensive quantity is a physical property of a system that scales linearly with the size of the system. For example, the volume of a gas is an extensive quantity because if you double the volume of the container in which the gas is held, the number of gas particles also doubles. Other examples of extensive quantities include the mass, energy, and entropy of a system.

In contrast, intensive quantities are physical properties of a system that do not depend on the size of the system. Examples of intensive quantities include temperature, pressure, and chemical potential.

In statistical mechanics, the concept of extensive and intensive quantities is used to describe the behavior of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. The relationships between extensive and intensive quantities can be described using the laws of thermodynamics, which provide a framework for understanding how energy is exchanged and transformed within a system.
