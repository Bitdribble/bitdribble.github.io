Q: What is the difference between batch optimization and mini-batch optimization?

---

In batch optimization, the entire dataset is used to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters for each iteration of the learning algorithm. This means that the model's parameters are updated based on the average loss over the entire dataset.

On the other hand, in mini-batch optimization, the dataset is divided into small batches and the gradient of the loss function is computed for each batch. The model's parameters are then updated based on the average loss of the batch.

The main difference between the two approaches is the amount of data used to compute the gradients and update the model's parameters. Batch optimization uses the entire dataset, while mini-batch optimization uses a small subset of the data.

There are trade-offs between the two approaches. Batch optimization is slower because it uses the entire dataset, but it can potentially lead to more accurate models because it uses more data. Mini-batch optimization is faster because it uses a smaller subset of the data, but it may lead to less accurate models because it uses less data.
