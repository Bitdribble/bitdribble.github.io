Q: Does any curve in plane have a Legendre transform?

---

In general, a Legendre transform can be defined for a differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval, and not necessarily for a curve in a plane. However, a function that is defined on an open interval can be considered as a curve in a plane if it is graphed, and in such cases, the Legendre transform of the function can be computed.

A Legendre transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a function into a new function with a specific relationship between its inputs and outputs. The Legendre transform is used in various areas of mathematics and physics, such as mechanics, optimization, and thermodynamics.

So, to answer your question, any real-valued function defined on an open interval has a Legendre transform, and this function can be considered as a curve in a plane if it is graphed.

Q: Is the Legendre transform idempotent?

---

The Legendre transform is not idempotent, meaning that applying the Legendre transform to a function twice does not result in the original function.

The Legendre transform is a one-to-one transformation that maps a function to its Legendre conjugate. The inverse of the Legendre transform, which maps the Legendre conjugate back to the original function, is also known as the Legendre transform. The relationship between the original function, its Legendre conjugate, and the Legendre transform is highly dependent on the properties of the original function.

In other words, the Legendre transform and its inverse do not cancel each other out when applied twice, and applying the Legendre transform to a function twice results in a different function than the original one.

Q: If the function is convex, is the Legendre transform also convex?

---

Yes, if the original function is convex, then its Legendre transform is also convex.

A function is considered convex if its graph lies above the line connecting any two points on the graph. The Legendre transform of a convex function is also a convex function. This can be seen by considering the relationship between the original function and its Legendre conjugate.

The Legendre transform of a function is the Legendre conjugate of the function, which is defined as the Legendre transform of the function with swapped arguments. The Legendre conjugate of a convex function is also convex, because the relationship between the original function and its Legendre conjugate preserves the convexity of the function.

In other words, if a function is convex, its Legendre transform (the Legendre conjugate) will also be convex.

Q: Can you define a Legendre conjugate of a function of multiple variables?

---

Yes, the Legendre conjugate of a function of multiple variables can be defined.

The Legendre conjugate of a function of multiple variables is a transformation that maps a function to a new function with a specific relationship between its inputs and outputs. It is a generalization of the Legendre transform for functions of one variable to functions of multiple variables.

Given a function f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) defined on an open set in n-dimensional space, its Legendre conjugate is another function g(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) defined on an open set in n-dimensional space, such that the relationship between f and g is given by:

f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) + g(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) = p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 + ... + p_n x_n,

where x_i and p_i are related by the equation:

p_i = ∂f/∂x_i

The Legendre conjugate of a function of multiple variables has applications in various areas of mathematics and physics, such as optimization, control theory, and thermodynamics.

Note that the Legendre conjugate of a function of multiple variables is not unique, and different Legendre conjugates can be obtained by choosing different sets of partial derivatives.
