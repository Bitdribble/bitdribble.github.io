Q: What is the watermark python module?

---

The `watermark` python module is a tool that can be used to print the current version numbers of relevant modules and their dependencies. This can be useful when sharing your work with others, to ensure that they are able to run your code with the same versions of the required modules that you used. The watermark module can also be used to print other information, such as the date and time, the hostname, and the user name. To use the watermark module, you first need to install it using pip:

```
pip install watermark
```

Once it is installed, you can use it in your code by importing it and calling its watermark function. For example:

```
%load_ext watermark

%watermark -v -m -p numpy,scipy,sklearn
```

This will print the versions of the `numpy, scipy, and sklearn` modules, along with the current version of the watermark module. You can also specify additional options to control what information is printed and how it is formatted. For more information, you can refer to the `watermark` module's documentation.
