Create a new Jekyll blog post with the title "$ARGUMENTS".

Please:

1. **Generate the filename** using the current date and a URL-friendly slug from the title
2. **Create the blog post file** in the `_posts/` directory with:
   - Proper Jekyll front matter (layout: post, title, date, categories)
   - Add `mathjax: true` if the topic might benefit from mathematical expressions
   - Include appropriate categories based on the topic (choose from: tech, programming, webdev, jekyll, tailwind, ai, tutorials, reviews)
3. **Structure the content** with:
   - An engaging introduction
   - Clear section headings
   - Placeholder content that matches the style of other posts on bitdribble.github.io
   - A conclusion
4. **Add relevant code examples** if the topic is technical
5. **Use Tailwind CSS** for any custom HTML layouts if needed
6. **Follow the writing style** of existing posts - technical but accessible, with practical examples

After creating the file, open it for editing and provide suggestions for the content structure and key points to cover.
