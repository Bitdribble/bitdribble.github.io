### Political Testament

To escape from a totalitarian universe—and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a camp, a prison, or another form of incarceration; the theory applies to any kind of product of totalitarianism—there is the (mystical) solution of faith. This will not be discussed in what follows, as it is a consequence of grace, which is inherently selective.

The three solutions we refer to are strictly worldly, have a practical character, and present themselves as accessible to anyone.

#### The First Solution: Solzhenitsyn's
In *The First Circle*, Aleksandr Isayevich briefly mentions it, elaborating further in Volume I of *The Gulag Archipelago*.

This solution consists, for anyone stepping over the threshold of the Security Service or any similar investigative body, in resolutely telling themselves: *At this very moment, I am dying*. It is permissible to console oneself with thoughts such as: *What a pity for my youth, or woe to my old age, my wife, my children, myself, my talent, my possessions, or my power, my lover, the wines I will no longer drink, the books I will no longer read, the walks I will no longer take, the music I will no longer listen to, etc., etc., etc.* But one thing is certain and irreversible: *From now on, I am a dead man.*

If one thinks this way, unwaveringly, they are saved. Nothing more can be done to them. They can no longer be threatened, blackmailed, deceived, or tricked. Since they consider themselves dead, nothing can frighten, seduce, or provoke them. They can no longer be manipulated. They no longer have—because they no longer hope, because they have left the world—anything to yearn for, preserve, or regain, nor anything for which to sell their soul, peace, or honor. There is no currency left in which the price of their betrayal can be paid.

Of course, this requires the decision to be firm and definitive. You declare yourself deceased, consent to your death, and eliminate all hope. You may have regrets, like Madame d'Houdetot; you may lament—but this moral and anticipatory suicide does not fail. The risk of yielding, of agreeing to denounce, or of making a fabricated confession then vanishes completely.
