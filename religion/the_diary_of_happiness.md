### Political Testament

To escape from a totalitarian universe—and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a camp, a prison, or another form of incarceration; the theory applies to any kind of product of totalitarianism—there is the (mystical) solution of faith. This will not be discussed in what follows, as it is a consequence of grace, which is inherently selective.

The three solutions we refer to are strictly worldly, have a practical character, and present themselves as accessible to anyone.

#### The First Solution: Solzhenitsyn's
In *The First Circle*, Aleksandr Isayevich briefly mentions it, elaborating further in Volume I of *The Gulag Archipelago*.

This solution consists, for anyone stepping over the threshold of the Security Service or any similar investigative body, in resolutely telling themselves: *At this very moment, I am dying*. It is permissible to console oneself with thoughts such as: *What a pity for my youth, or woe to my old age, my wife, my children, myself, my talent, my possessions, or my power, my lover, the wines I will no longer drink, the books I will no longer read, the walks I will no longer take, the music I will no longer listen to, etc., etc., etc.* But one thing is certain and irreversible: *From now on, I am a dead man.*

If one thinks this way, unwaveringly, they are saved. Nothing more can be done to them. They can no longer be threatened, blackmailed, deceived, or tricked. Since they consider themselves dead, nothing can frighten, seduce, or provoke them. They can no longer be manipulated. They no longer have—because they no longer hope, because they have left the world—anything to yearn for, preserve, or regain, nor anything for which to sell their soul, peace, or honor. There is no currency left in which the price of their betrayal can be paid.

Of course, this requires the decision to be firm and definitive. You declare yourself deceased, consent to your death, and eliminate all hope. You may have regrets, like Madame d'Houdetot; you may lament—but this moral and anticipatory suicide does not fail. The risk of yielding, of agreeing to denounce, or of making a fabricated confession then vanishes completely.

#### The Second Solution: Alexandr Zinoviev's

This solution is embodied by one of the characters in the book *The Yawning Heights*. The character is a young man presented under the allegorical nickname "The Misfit." The solution lies in total non-conformity within the system.

The Misfit has no permanent residence, no proper documents, and no employment; he is a vagabond, a parasite, a penniless drifter. He lives from one day to the next, surviving on what he is given, what falls his way, or what he can scrape together. He wears rags, works sporadically, sometimes, and only if the opportunity arises. He spends most of his time in prisons or labor camps, sleeping wherever he can. He wanders. Under no circumstances will he enter the system—not even in the most insignificant, sinful, or low-commitment job. Not even as a pig keeper, rejecting the example of the protagonist in an Arthur Schnitzler novella, who, obsessed with fear of responsibility, ends up as a swineherd.

No, the Misfit has existentially projected himself once and for all as an outcast, a scapegoat, a Buddhist beggar monk, a madman, free (and mad) in the name of freedom.

Such a person, existing on the fringes of society, is also immune: no pressures can be exerted on him, for there is nothing to take from him, and nothing to offer him. He can be imprisoned, harassed, despised, mocked at any time—but he slips through their grasp. Once and for all, he has consented to live his life following the example and model of a perpetual night asylum. Out of poverty, distrust, and unseriousness, he has made a creed; he resembles a wild animal, a scrawny beast, or a highway robber. He is Ferrante Palia from Stendhal. He is Zacharias Lichter from Matei Călinescu. He is a secular *iurodivyi* (holy fool), an untiring wanderer (and if Wotan descended to this earth, what name would he bear? *Der Wanderer*), a wandering Jew.

He is outspoken, talks incessantly, gives voice to the most dangerous anecdotes, knows no respect, mocks everything, says whatever comes to mind, and speaks truths that others dare not even whisper. He is the child from Andersen's tale of *The Emperor’s New Clothes*. He is the fool from *King Lear*. He is the wolf from La Fontaine’s bold fable: he knows nothing of collars.

He is free, free, free.

#### The Third Solution: Winston Churchill and Vladimir Bukovsky

This solution can be summarized as follows: in the face of tyranny, oppression, misery, disasters, calamities, dangers—not only do you refuse to give up, but you also draw from them a mad desire to live and fight.

In March 1939, Churchill told Martha Bibescu: *"There will be war. The British Empire will be reduced to dust and ashes. Death is stalking us all. And yet, I feel as though I am twenty years younger."*

The worse things get—the more immense the difficulties, the harder the blows, the more surrounded or attacked you are, the less hope you have, the more the grayness, darkness, and viscous entanglements intensify and tighten—the more you long for the fight, and the more you experience a growing, inexplicable, and overwhelming euphoria.

You are assaulted from all sides by forces infinitely greater than your own: you fight. They defeat you: you defy them. You are lost: you attack. (This is how Churchill spoke in 1940.) You laugh, sharpen your teeth and knife, and grow younger. You are tingled with happiness—the indescribable joy of striking back, even if far less effectively than they strike you. Not only do you refuse to despair, to declare yourself defeated and overcome, but you also fully savor the joy of resistance, of defiance, and you feel an unstoppable, madly exuberant sense of joy.

This solution, of course, requires exceptional strength of character, a military philosophy of life, a formidable moral resilience, a will of hardened steel, and adamantine spiritual health. It likely also requires a sporting spirit: to enjoy the battle itself—the clash—more than success.

This approach, too, is salvational and absolute because it is based on a paradox: the more they strike you, hurt you, impose ever more unjust suffering, and corner you in increasingly hopeless situations, the happier you become. The stronger you grow. The younger you feel.

Churchill’s solution aligns with Vladimir Bukovsky’s as well. Bukovsky recounts that when he received his first summons to the KGB headquarters, he couldn’t close his eyes all night. Naturally, the reader of his memoirs might assume it was due to fear, insecurity, or emotion. But Bukovsky continues: *"I couldn’t sleep out of impatience. I could hardly wait for morning to confront them, to tell them everything I thought about them, and to charge at them like a tank. I couldn’t imagine greater happiness."*

This is why he couldn’t sleep: not out of fear, worry, or emotion, but from the impatience to shout the truth to their faces and to charge at them like a tank!

I doubt more extraordinary words have ever been spoken or written. And I wonder—not claiming it as truth, merely pondering—whether this universe, with its swarms of galaxies each containing thousands or millions of stars, each surrounded by billions of planets, all measured in light-years, parsecs, and unfathomable distances; whether all this matter, these stars, comets, satellites, pulsars, quasars, black holes, cosmic dust, meteors, and so on; whether all the eras, eons, times, and space-time continua, whether all Newtonian and relativistic astrophysics—could have come into existence for the sole purpose of allowing Bukovsky’s words to be spoken.

#### Conclusion

All three solutions are certain and unfailing.  

I know of no other ways to escape from a life-threatening situation, a totalitarian universe, the clutches of a Kafkaesque process, a domino game, a labyrinth, an interrogation room, fear and panic, a mouse trap, or a phenomenal nightmare. Only these three. But any one of them is sufficient, effective, and liberating.

Take note: **Solzhenitsyn**, **Zinoviev**, **Churchill**, **Bukovsky**.  
- The acceptance, assumption, anticipation, or provocation of death.  
- Indifference and defiance.  
- Bravery accompanied by a wild sense of joy.  

You are free to choose. But you must realize that, speaking in worldly and human terms, it is highly unlikely you will find another way to confront the iron circle—which, in large part, is also a chalk circle (see Camus’s *State of Siege*: the foundation of dictatorship is a phantom: fear).  

You may protest, perhaps, arguing that these solutions imply a form of life equivalent to death—or worse than death—or involving the risk of physical death at any moment. And that is true. Are you surprised? That is because you have not read Igor Shafarevich, because you have not yet learned that totalitarianism is not so much the solidification of an economic, biological, or social theory, but rather the manifestation of an attraction to death.  

And the secret of those who cannot fit into the totalitarian abyss is simple: they love life, not death.  

But death — who Alone has conquered it? The One who, raised from the dead, dieth no more.
