All courses and lecture notes are at [Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/).

[The Distinction of Past and Future](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/fml.html#5)
High level talk to high school students about reversibility of all physical laws except the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Examples from life, no formulas. Entropy explained as inability to extract energy.

[L39 The kinetic theory of gases](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_39.html)
* Equal volumes of gases, at the same pressure and temperature, contain the same number of molecules. The law of multiple proportions, that when two gases combine in a chemical reaction the volumes needed always stand in simple integral proportions, was understood ultimately by Avogadro to mean that equal volumes have equal numbers of atoms.
