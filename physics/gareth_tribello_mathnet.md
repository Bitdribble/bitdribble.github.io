Notes on [MathNet](http://gtribello.github.io/mathNET)

* [An introduction to statistical mechanics and the principle of equal a priori probabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LdL1LUrE0I)
  * Ludwig Boltzmann's principle of apriori probabilities, in modern formulation:
    * Suppose we have some atoms.
    * Their state in Newtonian physics is characterized by their _position_ and _momentum_ $$x_i, p_i$$.
    * The states an atom could have in terms of position and momentum are called _microstates_.
    * The set of all possible microstates is called _phase space_.
    
* [The Generalized Partition Function](http://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/generalised-partition-video.html)
For a system of particles in thermodinamic equilibrium
* [Model Systems III: The statistical mechanics of the ideal gas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOOV1K5mKeY)
