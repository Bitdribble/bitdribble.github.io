[An introduction to statistical mechanics and the principle of equal a priori probabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LdL1LUrE0I)
* Ludwig Boltzmann's principle of apriori probabilities, shortened, and in modern formulation:
  * Suppose we have some atoms.
  * Their state in Newtonian physics is characterized by their _position_ and _momentum_ $$x_i, p_i$$.
  * The states an atom could have in terms of position and momentum are called _microstates_.
  * The set of all possible microstates of all atoms together is called _phase space_.
  * Each microstate has associated values for its thermodynamic _extensive quantities_
    * Extensive quantities are physical properties of a system that scales linearly with the size of the system - e.g. the volume of a gas, mass, energy, and entropy
    * Intensive quantities are physical properties that do not depend on the size of the system - e.g. temperature, pressure, and chemical potential.
  * For a given energy level $$E$$, at equilibrium, the microstates with that energy are equally distributed.
  * The system moves freely between microstates at that level of energy.
  * From this simple statement, the whole edifice of Statistical Mechanics is buult
  * Within Statistical Mechanics, we find an answer of sorts to the question 'what is Entropy'
    
* [The Generalized Partition Function](http://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/generalised-partition-video.html)
  * Suppose the system microstates are constituted by triples of energy, volume, and number of atoms $$(E_i, V_i, p_i)$ with expected values

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle E \rangle &= \sum_i E_i p_i & 
\langle V \rangle &= \sum_i V_i p_i &
\langle N \rangle &= \sum_i N_i p_i
\end{align*}
