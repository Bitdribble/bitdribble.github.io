#### Tools
* [Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro)
  * Molecular Visualization - rotating, zooming, and highlighting specific parts of the molecule
  * Molecular Editing
  * Molecular Docking - a computational technique used to predict how a small molecule (e.g., a drug candidate) interacts with a target protein or receptor. It helps researchers analyze and optimize the binding affinity and orientation of ligands within the target protein's active site
  * Molecular Dynamics Simulations - simulate the movements and interactions of atoms and molecules over time. This feature helps researchers study the behavior and stability of biomolecules, as well as their interactions with small molecules.
  * Virtual Screening - allowing users to screen large libraries of compounds virtually to identify potential drug candidates
  * Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationship (QSAR) Analysis
