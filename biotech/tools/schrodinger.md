#### Tools
* [Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro)
  * Molecular Visualization - rotating, zooming, and highlighting specific parts of the molecule
  * Molecular Editing
  * Molecular Docking - a computational technique used to predict how a small molecule (e.g., a drug candidate) interacts with a target protein or receptor. It helps researchers analyze and optimize the binding affinity and orientation of ligands within the target protein's active site
  * Molecular Dynamics Simulations - simulate the movements and interactions of atoms and molecules over time. This feature helps researchers study the behavior and stability of biomolecules, as well as their interactions with small molecules.
  * Virtual Screening - allowing users to screen large libraries of compounds virtually to identify potential drug candidates
  * Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationship (QSAR) Analysis

* [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/)
  * Molecular Visualization
  * Molecular Editing
    * Adding or removing atoms, bonds, and residues, as well as performing basic molecular building tasks
  * Molecular Surface Generation - visualizing the shape and properties of macromolecules. Surface representations can be used to study protein-ligand interactions, protein-protein interactions, and other structural features.
  * Electrostatic Surface Calculation - calculate and display electrostatic potential surfaces of molecules. This feature helps researchers understand the distribution of positive and negative charges on a molecule, which is important for studying molecular interactions.
  * Protein Structure Analysis - analyze protein structures. It allows users to measure distances, angles, and dihedral angles within a protein, as well as perform structural alignments and superpositions.
  * Molecular Dynamics Visualization - read trajectory files generated from molecular dynamics simulations and animate the molecular structures over time, allowing researchers to observe the movements and conformational changes of biomolecules.
  * Scripting and Automation - automate tasks, customize visualization settings, and perform complex analysis workflows. The scripting language used in PyMOL is Python, which provides flexibility and extensibility to the software.
  * Has open source subset: [schrodinger/pymol-open-source](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source)
